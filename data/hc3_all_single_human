0 In your brain are these things called neurotransmitters Each of them do different things Some of them , like serotonin and norepinephrine , make you happy Sometimes though , with people with depression \( also called major depression disorder \) , your brain has less of these happy chemicals When this happens , you feel sad , lazy and your favourite things seem boring and awful Even when something good happens and you want to feel happy , you ca n't You just feel lazy and sad , lazy and sad Some people get this illness because somebody in their family had it Just like how having black hair is genetic , so are some illnesses , like depression For some people , what 's called an environmental trigger will set off the illness That 's if something bad happens to that person If it was something really , really scary , like rape or war , it is n't called depression It is called post traumatic stress disorder , and it 's a little different For people with depression , changes happen in their brain The part of the brain that makes you feel scared gets bigger , and the part of your brain that makes memories gets smaller Treatment for depression starts with therapy The act of talking just moving your mouth and saying words at people increases one of your happy chemicals in your brain If therapy does n't help , a doctor may try medicine These medicines trick your brain into thinking you have more happy chemicals

0 Roth 401k Make contributions with money after you have already paid taxes on the money and never pay taxes on it again no matter how much it appreciates Traditional Get a tax deduction now and pay the taxes on it when you take the money out in retirement On the surface it sounds like the Roth growing tax free for all of those years is a huge benefit but the math works out the same Here is an example You have 5 , 000 of your pretax salary to contribute If your tax rate is 25 you could put all 5 , 000 of that into a traditional IRA because you do n't pay tax on the money in the current year If you want to use that 5 , 000 to fund a roth you would pay tax on it now which means you would only put 3 , 750 into the Roth As a result the balance in your traditional IRA will be much larger when you retire because you contributed more to it each year Assuming the tax rate stays the same at 25 the entire time if you took all of the money out of the traditional and paid the 25 tax on the entire amount it would be the same exact amount as the Roth The reason I went through that example is to illustrate that the only thing that matters in making this decision is what you think your tax rate will be when you retire compared to what it is now If you think your tax rate is lower now than it will be at the end of your career \( which is probably is \) then you should elect the roth so you pay the taxes now instead of later One more thing , the most important aspect of 401ks is to get the full employer match So if selecting the roth means you ca n't contribute enough to get the full match then you should do the traditional

0 Revenue Canada allows for some amount of tax deferral via several methods The point is that none of them allow you to avoid tax , but by deferring from years when you have high income to years when you have lower income allows you to realize less total tax paid due to the marginal rate for personal income tax The corporate dividend approach \( as explained in another answer \) is one way TFSAs are another way , but as you point out , they have limits Since you brought TFSAs into your question About the best and easiest tax deferral option available in Canada is the RRSP If you do n't have a company pension , you can contribute something like 18 of your income If you have a pension plan , you may still be able to contribute to an RRSP as well , but the maximum contribution amount will be lower The contribution lowers your taxable income which can save you tax Interest earned on the equity in your RRSP is n't taxed Tax is only paid on money drawn from the plan because it is deemed income in that year They are intended for retirement , but you 're allowed to withdraw at any time , so if you have little or no income in a year , you can draw money from your RRSP Tax is withheld , which you may or may not get back depending on your taxable income for that year You can think of it as a way to level your income and lower your legitimate tax burden

0 There are reasons why some people do not like feminism Some people do not like feminism because they think that women are already equal or more important in the law Anti feminists often say that society is also not equal for men and that women have more rights in child custody and divorce Some say that feminism wants women to be more important than men Some argue that women and men have simple biological differences , and thus can not be treated in the same way Some examples are the treatment and role of women in the military and pregnancy only happens to women Some people do not like feminism because it wants to change society and it could make men have less power Feminism could give women special rights that would then hurt other groups and their rights An example would be a fear that women would take away jobs normally done by men Some religious people say that feminism is not what God wanted For example , in Genesis chapter 2 it says that God made Eve \( the first woman \) as a companion for Adam \( the first man \) and some think this means he made women to serve men But some feel that God created men and women to be equal \( see Ephesians 5 21 \) This leads to Christian and Jewish denominations differing on the ordination of women \( whether women can be official leaders in a church See also Women in Islam There are also many other types of anti feminism Writers such as Camille Paglia , Christina Hoff Sommers , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Elizabeth Fox Genovese and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism , though they identify as feminists They argue , for example , that feminism often promotes misandry \( hatred of men \) and the elevation of women 's interests above men 's , and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term anti feminist is used to silence academic debate about feminism Source URL 0

0 The general rule of thumb for interspecies breeding is that it comes down to chromosomes , which are strands of DNA The rest of the Great Apes \( Gorillas , Chimps , Bonobos , Orangutans \) have 48 chromosomes , but 2 of these chromosome have fused in Humans , leaving us with 46 chromosomes The greater the difference in the number of chromosomes , the harder it is for species to breed Basically , the sex cells \( sperm egg \) have problems aligning and combining when the chromosome count is off This has n't stopped animals with different number of chromosomes from interbreeding Mules are the best example Horses have 64 chromosome and donkeys have 62 , so this is similar to the difference between Humans and the rest of the apes So we can see that a different number of chromosomes is a problem , but not an impossible barrier , for making hybrids The other main biological problem comes down to the immune system Your body automatically recognizes when things are not self Any outside matter that enters into your system is immediately attacked by your immune system For pregnancy , this concept is most important when it comes down to blood types The positive negative you hear about human blood types refers to a specific blood type Basically , if a mother is negative and the fetus is positive than the mother 's immune system will attack the blood of the fetus , which can lead to a miscarriage Chimps and humans have equivalent systems that they share So , a humanzee fetus would need to have a mother and father with matching blood subtypes The biggest problem to breeding humans with other apes is not biological The simple fact is that , while it is biologically possible \( if not likely \) , making a human ape hybrid is a bit too mad science y for most people No reputable institution would fund the research , no ape center would allow their animals to take part , and the outcry from the public and scientific community would shut down any private project pretty quickly

0 In addition to the other answers , here 's a proper strategy that implements your idea If the options are priced properly they should account for future dividend payments , so all other things aside , a put option that is currently at the money should be in the money after the dividend , and hence more expensive than a put option that is out of the money today but at the money after the dividend has been paid The unprotected futures \( if priced correctly \) should account for dividend payments based on the dividend history and , since maturing after the payment , should earn you \( you sell them \) less money because you deliver the physical after the dividend has been paid The protected ones should reflect the expected total return value of the stock at the time of maturity \( i e the dividend is mentally calculated into the price \) , and any dividend payments that happen on the way will be debited from your cash \( and credited to the counterparty \) Now that 's the strategy that leaves you with nearly no risk \( the only risk you bear is that the dividend is n't as high as you expected \) But for that comfort you have to pay premiums So to see if you 're smarter than the market , subtract all the costs for the hedging instruments from your envisaged dividend yield and see if your still better than the lending rate If so , do the trade

0 The right to privacy is an element of various legal traditions that intends to restrain governmental and private actions that threaten the privacy of individuals failed verification Over 150 national constitutions mention the right to privacy On 10 December 1948 , the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \( UDHR \) , originally written to guarantee individual rights of everyone everywhere while right to privacy does not appear in the document , many interpret this through Article 12 , which states No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy , family , home or correspondence , nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks Since the global surveillance disclosures of 2013 , initiated by ex NSA employee Edward Snowden , the right to privacy has been a subject of international debate Government agencies , such as the NSA , FBI , CIA , R AW and GCHQ , have engaged in mass , global surveillance Some current debates around the right to privacy include whether privacy can co exist with the current capabilities of intelligence agencies to access and analyze many details of an individual 's life whether or not the right to privacy is forfeited as part of the social contract to bolster defense against supposed terrorist threats and whether threats of terrorism are a valid excuse to spy on the general population Private sector actors can also threaten the right to privacy particularly technology companies , such as Amazon , Apple , Meta , Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo that use and collect personal data These concerns have been strengthened by scandals , including the Facebook Cambridge Analytica data scandal , which focused on psychographic company Cambridge Analytica which used personal data from Facebook to influence large groups of people

0 THE PROLOGUE A group of extremely powerful guys form the Wisemen 's Committee , which is basically a group that rules the world from behind the scenes The group gets bigger , and name themselves The Philosophers They pool shitloads of money together and continue ruling the world One of their members tries to expose their existence to the world They kill him His daughter goes on to become a legendary soldier codenamed The Joy , because she enjoys war so much She and her unit kick all kinds of ass all through World War II Because she kicked so much ass , she is renamed The Boss and gains a reputation as a living legend She takes on a protege METAL GEAR SOLID 3 SNAKE EATER The Boss ' protege , codenamed Naked Snake is sent on a mission to Russia during the height of the Cold War The Boss betrays him and steals a powerful new nuclear tank called the Shagohod This is important because the Shagohod was designed as a competitive alternative for the world shatteringly important weapon known as Metal Gear Naked Snake fights a Russian Soldier named Ocelot Ocelot goes on to be an absurdly important character thirty years later Naked Snake kills his way through the Boss ' old unit , destroys the shit out of the Shagohod to stop it from being used to spark World War III , and then kills the Boss Naked Snake then finds out that the Boss was n't really a bad guy after all , she was just so idealistic and devoted to her duty that she was willing to give her life and die as a villain rather than betray her orders Naked Snake is given the name of Big Boss , basically just to prove that he was an even bigger badass than she was INTERMISSION Out of respect to the extraordinary ideals of the Boss , Big Boss and all the people who helped him on his mission decide to create the Patriots The Patriots pick up where the Philosophers left off and begin controlling the world from behind the scenes The US Government basically looks at Big Boss and says Holy shit man , he 's like the most perfect soldier ever , we got ta try and clone him and make more of that shit ! So they steal his DNA and make three clones One is named Solid Snake One is named Liquid Snake And the other is named Solidus basically just because they did n't want to call him Gassy Snake , I suppose Sure enough , they all grow up to be fucking fantastic soldiers but none of them know that they 're actually clones While the US Government is doing all this cloning shit , Big Boss gets fed up and just quits the world , and goes to Africa to start his own country He decides to call his country Outer Heaven METAL GEAR Solid Snake is sent into Outer Heaven to kill Big Boss He does METAL GEAR 2 Turns out Big Boss survived So Solid Snake is sent to kill him again Solid Snake fights a soldier named Gray Fox and kills him Solid Snake kills Big Boss for real this time METAL GEAR SOLID Solid Snake is sent to an Alaskan facility for disposing of nuclear missiles , which has been seized by terrorists Solid Snake finds out that the terrorists are led by Liquid Snake Solid Snake is infected with a virus called FOXDIE which uses nanomachines in the body to kill certain people and it can tell which people to kill based on their DNA Solid Snake meets a guy named Otacon Solid Snake finds out the disposal facility is actually a research facility for Metal Gear , which is an indestructible tank capable of launching nukes anywhere in the world Basically the ultimate weapon Solid Snake meets Ocelot , who is now one of the terrorists Ocelot 's hand is cut off by a cyborg ninja The cyborg ninja turns out to be Gray Fox , who is n't dead Gray Fox is then killed later on by Metal Gear , being piloted by Liquid Snake After killing all the terrorists and stopping them from using Metal Gear , FOXDIE kills Liquid Snake instead of Solid Snake because they have the same DNA METAL GEAR SOLID 2 SONS OF LIBERTY Solid Snake and Otacon , who are now best buddies , start an organization devoted to getting rid of Metal Gears because they 've become popular all over the world Solid Snake infiltrates an oil tanker that is secretly carrying a new type of Metal Gear specifically designed to kill other Metal Gears The tanker gets hijacked by a bunch of Russian soldiers , led by Ocelot Ocelot 's hand \( and for that matter , his whole freaking arm \) has been replaced by using one of Liquid Snake 's This apparently gives Liquid Snake the ghostly ability to possess Ocelot 's mind every now and then The tanker explodes , a natural disaster occurs , and a huge cleanup facility called the Big Shell is erected to fix it Two years later a totally new character named Raiden shows up He 's sent to liberate the Big Shell from terrorists who 've seized control of it He teams up with Solid Snake , who shows up every now and then Raiden meets a cyborg ninja similar to the one Solid Snake met back in MGS Raiden kills his way through the terrorists until suddenly he 's swarmed by tons of shattering revelations First of all the terrorists are led by Solidus Snake \( who at this point is a former US president How the hell this makes sense is never explained that much \) Second , Raiden learns about the existence of the Patriots and their secret role in controlling the world Third , the Big Shell is actually a new type of Metal Gear called Arsenal Gear which was built to protect a supercomputer , controlled by an artificial intelligence This AI , which is codenamed GW after the initials of George Washington , was designed to control the flow of all information around the world Fourth , Raiden 's entire mission has been set up as a simulation of Solid Snakes original mission in MGS , to test the Patriot 's new system of controlling the masses Fifth , the cyborg ninja is revealed to be a Russian soldier named Olga , who helped Ocelot hijack the tanker in the beginning of the game She is being forced to help Raiden \( thus betraying her Russian comrades \) by the Patriots , who are holding her baby daughter hostage She 's killed later by Solidus Raiden kills Solidus , and obtains a list of the Patriot 's members INTERMISSION The Patriots use their new system to steadily gain total control of the world They specifically gain control over the wars and conflicts around the world , and purposely create a global economy that depends on war to survive Raiden then goes and rescues Olga 's daughter , Sunny , but he is captured by the Patriots and experimented on , being turned into yet another cyborg ninja METAL GEAR SOLID 4 GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS Solid Snake has undergone rapid aging because of the way his clone body is designed plus he still has FOXDIE in his body Therefore he 's renamed Old Snake Old Snake is sent on a hit mission to kill Ocelot , who has now been totally possessed by the ghost of Liquid Snake 's hand Therefore he 's renamed Liquid Ocelot Old Snake meets with the remnants of the Patriots , and discovers their identity and history He then finds out that Liquid Ocelot is trying to hunt them down so he can use their system of control to rule the world To do this he needs the body of Big Boss , which the Patriots are hiding Ocelot eventually succeeds , and gains control of the system With the help of cyborg Raiden , Old Snake then destroys the system by using a computer virus to destroy the Artificial Intelligences that are running it Old Snake and Liquid Ocelot have a final battle , in which Old Snake kills him It 's then revealed that Ocelot was NEVER actually being controlled by the ghost of Liquid Snake , Ocelot was simply pretending to do that to fool the AI 's and everyone else , thus hiding his true motives His true motives were to destroy the AI 's and send the world into chaos , thus fulfilling his idea of what Big Boss ' dream was But the world does n't descend into chaos , because the virus Old Snake used to stop the AI 's was designed to keep vital systems up and running to preserve the world order Snake meets Big Boss \( who has somehow come back to life \) , and after Big Boss kills the last remaining Patriot and himself , the world is finally free from the control and the legacy of the Patriots Old Snake goes to quietly live out the rest of his days EDIT Okay , I fixed a bunch of the errors you guys pointed out Thanks for doing that , to be honest I have n't played any of the games in years , and I just typed this whole thing out from memory Also , I have n't played

0 Basically what you 're doing is , you are rotating number 1 by 180 degrees on a number line , so it now points towards negative side Why e to the power if i times pi means the same as doing what I just said , well , that may take some explaining First of all , complex numbers They are rather simple If you know real numbers as points on a real number line , then complex numbers are quite simply points , not on a line , but on a two dimensional plane Real numbers are where they used to be , on a line , but above 0 , there is i Below 0 , there is i Below 1 , there is 1 i , et cetera Basically , it 's just a plane Adding two complex numbers is more or less what you would expect \( 2 3i \) \( 3 i \) 5 2i Multiplying however is where all the usefulness comes from If you imagine complex numbers as points on a plane , then each point has distance from point 0 , and it has angle Each positive real number has angle of 0 degrees Each negative real number has angle of 180 degrees In mathematics , we often use different unit for angles , so instead of 360 degrees , we say 2 pi radians 180 degrees is pi radians 0 degrees is 0 pi radians Reasons for this separate unit of measuring angles is a bit too long to include here , but it 's really just measuring angles in a different unit Miles or kilometers , kilograms or pounds , it 's still angles we talk about So instead of negative numbers having 180 degrees angle , we say its pi radians angle They point in direction of pi radians And as it turns out , when we multiply real numbers , we can think of it involving adding up the angles ! If you multiply 2 with 3 , the answer has length of 6 , but since first multiplicant has angle of 0 , and second has 180 degrees \( or pi radians \) , end result has angle of pi radians 2 times 3 also has length of 6 , but now it has angle of 2 pi radians , which is the same as 0 radians , because you 've just gone full circle So the answer is 6 For complex number multiplication , it 's the same You multiply the lengths , and then add up the angles This does n't quite get us to why e i pi 1 though , but hopefully it made it easier to understand when I claim that pi in that equation is essentially just saying , this is by how much we turn Also should be noted that e 0 1 Since exponent basically stretches the number , you can think of 0 exponent just saying we 're not stretching or shrinking at all , leaving only the original length Since in our original equation we have e i pi e 0 i pi And because we can split that sum in exponent as multiplication , we get e 0 e i pi e 0 there is 1 , and it 's multiplied , or redirected , by pi , so you 'll have it point to negative direction I do n't know how to explain in accessible way the actual proof for why exponentiation with imaginary unit does such rotation , though But the intuition behind is that complex numbers really just like spinning and rotating , and if e i wants to spin around while doing otherwise nothing , that 's his own decision and we should all respect that

0 what do you mean exactly \? Do you have a future target price and projected future dividend payments and you want the present value \( time discounted price \) of those \?

0 Simply put , there are too many variables and there are few equivalences among classes Lets talk WoW We 'll take a relatively simple relationship Fear vs Sheep Both of these are supposed to be a long duration hard CC , but which one is better \? Sheep effectively roots a hero and is really easy to control , and also offers some tech against certain skills like spell reflection , while Fear does n't function quite the same , but has some damage tolerance A frost mage getting interrupted out of Sheep really is n't the end of the world , since you still have access to all that is the Frost school , but a Warlock getting knocked out of the Shadow school is a pretty big bummer , almost regardless of spec A really long story short , Fear is a better spell for a Warlock and Sheep is a better spell for a Mage It 's a kind of spell that 's sensitive to the context of the class \( and it 's part of what makes WoW brilliant \) It 's hard to give each spell a power value as a result You ca n't say , ' Fear has a Power Rating of 8 5 and Sheep has a Power Rating of 7 , therefore , we need to give Mages another 1 5 Power to compensate So what happens is that instead of balancing the game from the bottom up with careful planning , spreadsheets and testing , the game is balanced from the top down System Designers get to observe what is happening in the actual game and make decisions based on player choices , trends and what seems to actually work You do this because the game is simply too complex to put on paper Sure , you can control for itemization and all that jazz , but at the end of the day , you can manufacture a team and scenario where some class or some ability is the best one That is the both the problem and beauty of games like WoW A lot of people like to cite the Extra Credit 's Video Perfect Imbalance But it 's dead wrong on this one Now , I love this series , I love their videos and I love the people behind it , but they are so very , very wrong about this The video suggests that if designers wanted to , they could balance their games perfectly but choose not to in the name of a shifting meta , and while this is true for simple games , as you dive deeper and deeper into the complexities of modern games , it becomes less and less realistic WoW is incredibly complicated Starcraft is incredibly complicated You ca n't truly balance these games , because you are stuck doing it from the Top Down perspective Look at the Beta phase of Starcraft II It was 3 years long It was that long largely for balance reasons Blizzard handed out copies of the beta to high level players and said , ' Play our game and tell us what sucks ' , and they did , and it worked really well , but it was really expensive Make no mistake , if Blizzard could have sat down and just balanced the game on paper instead of having to invest 3 years and untold amounts of cash to do it , they would have , but they ca n't and they know that , which is why the beta and feedback system was necessary Brood War might have gotten as close as we 'll see any game of it 's complexity come to ' Perfect Balance ' with 1 08 , but even that game falls victim to complaints from higher level players What you see instead in BW is that win rates start to become attached to maps Whether or not that 's more or less desirable is up for debate , but it is a symptom of some kind of imbalance Designers do n't tweak their games to have some imbalances in them Instead , they are stuck with a product that can never be balanced in the first place In the same way that you can never turn an Apple into an Orange , you 'll never make a Warlock equal to a Mage Games that try to do that are actually quite boring , but good developers embrace that and you end up with beautiful complexity that is available in no other medium

0 Sure , it 's irresponsible for an executor to take actions which endanger the estate But what about passivity or inaction \? Put it another way Is it the obligation of the executor to avoid making revenue for the estate \? Think about it what a silly idea ! Consider a 12 unit apartment building full of rent paying tenants A tenant gives notice and leaves So do 4 more With only 7 12 tenants , the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit Is that acceptable \? Heck no ! Realistically this will be managed by a property management company , and of course they 'll seek new tenants , not stopping merely because the owner died This situation is not different the same fiscal logic applies The counter argument is usually along the lines of stuff might happen if you rent it out true But the stuff that happens to abandoned houses is much worse , and much more likely squatters , teen urban explorers , pot growers , copper thieves , winter pipe freeze flooding and wrecking interiors , etc Do n't take my word on it ask your insurer for the cost of insuring an abandoned house vs a rented one Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants 12 , 000 year on a 1000 mo rental And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates But on an old mortgage , renting is like printing money That money propagates first to the estate \( presumably it is holding back a fix the roof emergency fund \) , and then to the beneficiaries It means getting annual checks from the estate , instead of constantly being dunned for another repair But I do n't care about making revenue \( outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof \) Even if it was net zero , it means the maintenance is being done This being the point It is keeping the house in good repair , occupied , insured , and professionally managed fit and ready for the bequest 's purpose occupancy of an aunt What 's the alternative \? Move an aunt into a house that 's been 10 years abandoned \?

0 It 's called multilineal evolution in Anthropology Basically each culture evolves differently based on the problems that face them and their access to energy It 's really impossible to give a complete answer when adaptation is so nuanced , especially given how science technology becomes a chain of events predicated on a previous discovery Say , for example , your society does n't invent writing in 3500 BC like this other culture over here did maybe it does n't come around for you until 1000 BC In the meantime that other culture has 2000 years to invent mathematics , rudimentary engineering , and most importantly the ability to pass down knowledge speed up the process of acquiring new technology So then by about the time you 've figured how to write shit down that other culture is figuring out this swell new thing in the ground called iron And so on and so forth It just kind of snowballs in favor of the culture that got there first Combine that with access or not to food which ultimately allows you to create larger and more specialized societies as your people are n't spending the majority of their waking hours fending off starvation If you ended up in something like the Fertile Crescent you eventually got early civilization as we know it If you ended up in a malaria infested jungle , you did n't have time to invent shit like writing , math , metallurgy , iron , steel , etc because you were busy trying to not starve and you were constantly replacing diseased dead people Basically it boils down to who got the good land and who got the shitty land

0 Ok , in a web development suite there 's a few different components From top to bottom 1 Client side dynamic interaction \( javascript \) 1 Client side static rendering \( html css \) 1 Server side dynamic page generation \( php java rails django etc \) 1 Databases Allow me to explain how the languages fit in Client side HTML and CSS are used to determine how your page looks You can add a box here and change a background there All of the boxes and texts and pictures you specify in HTML are drawn \( called rendered \) by the user 's browser Now , you as a site designer can also tell the user 's browser to put up animation and interactivity You do this by specifying it in javascript Either before , after , or while a browser draws a page , it will read the javascript file you included and follow the instructions in there This is typically used for stuff like if the user clicks this picture , then make the picture fly across the screen and then show a login window Now this is all fine and good , but there 's a problem With only these browser rendered things going on , the page will ALWAYS look the same every time you visit it Why \? Because your html page will never change ! What needs to be done are server processing Server side A server is the computer that stores the website In order to tell the server to do things , you need to code in a server side language What this enables you to do is have the server automatically generate html based on how you coded it up For example Instead of simply writing an html that create text box , writing server side code can allow you to do something like this Fetch all the comments from a database and then for each comment print out an html div that contains its contents Example \? php comments getCommentsFromDatabase \( \) if \( comments 0 \) for \( comments as oneComment \) loop through all the comments echo div class 'commentsDiv ' comments contents \( \) div generate html \? With this in place your site is now dynamic As users post more comments , your page will look different Java , php , ruby on rails , python django , etc are all different languages that can be used to accomplish this They all have their pros and cons and it is up to the developer to choose one Server Client communication However , there is still a flaw in this The thing with server side processing is that it happens only when the user fetches the page This means that if information changes , a user must refresh the page in order to tell the server to cook up some new html for this page What if you do n't want to do that \? What if you want your website to automatically update the page even without the user having to refresh \? This is when you do something tricky called AJAX \( Asynchronous javascript and xmlhttp \) Asynchronous means that other things do n't have to wait for it What it means is that you code your javascript in such a way that it tells the browser to send off a specific message to the server asking for information For instance you can code it to do something like every 5 seconds , send a message to the server asking if there 's a new comment on the page Once the server sends me the new comment , draw it on the screen as an html div Message Formats Now what format do we use to send this message to the server and back \? Of course you can use any format you like , but there 's some standard ways that developers like to send this message Two major ones are JSON \( JavaScript object notation \) , and XML \( eXtensible Markup Language \) JSON looks like a javascript array , and xml just looks like html Example of JSON name razor storm , comment content once upon a time I ate a pig , trophies joined reddit , reddit mold , big Examples of XML comment name attr username razor storm name content length 28 time 09 01 2013 once upon a time I ate a pig content trophies li joined reddit li li reddit mold li li big li trophies comment

0 I am NOT an astronomer astrophysicist or anything like that , but I am an astronomy fan So this is the standard response to the best of my ability to explain it REAL ELI5 Remember when we went to the zoo and saw the real bears \? They looked a lot like Mr Teddy , but not as cuddly and not as friendly We call them both ' bears ' because they have a lot of things in common , but you would n't want to sleep in the same bed as the bear at the zoo When I said that the universe was ' expanding ' , it 's like that It looks a lot like when you blow up a balloon , but it 's different in some important ways One of these is that there is no such thing as outside the universe Even Daddy has trouble when he tries to think about it Ugly Fuller Explanation Space is an aspect of the universe There is nothing outside the universe because there is no outside of the universe The universe is not happening in a space and is not displacing anything It 's just that the amount of space between things is increasing in every direction in proportion to the distance between them That is if you have one kilometer of space , after an amount of time that we 'll call T , you will have two Kilometers of distance , and after another T of time , you will have four kilometers Because this is difficult to visualize , we use the almost correct concept of ' expansion ' as an easier to understand placeholder that works for most cases , but not in all , including this one It is like there is no ' design ' in evolution , but it 's a handy almost right and much easier concept So this is not ELI5 stuff It may not be possible to actually do that as it requires thinking in ways that we are not predisposed to do , but I will give it a shot This is somewhere in the middle of nowhere so we can ignore gravity and the complications it brings A really large amount of time that if I tried to calculate I 'd screw up

0 What would be the consequences if they do realize their error some day in the far future \? You 've informed them of the error and they 've informed you that nevertheless the points are yours and you should use them So you have a couple of issues have you made what your jurisdiction considers a reasonable effort to correct the mistake , and did the customer service rep actually have the authority to make such a large goodwill gesture as letting you keep all the points \? The first is your legal responsibility \( otherwise you 're stealing \) , and you need to know specifically for your jurisdiction whether a phone call is sufficient I ca n't tell you that Maybe you should send them a letter , maybe you should wait until you 've had written confirmation from them , maybe you 're OK as you are You might be able to get free advice from some body that helps with consumer issues \( here in the UK you could ask Citizen 's Advice \) The second is beyond your ability to know for sure but it 's not dishonest to work on the basis that what the company 's proper representative tells you , is true With the usual caveats that I'm not qualified to give legal advice once told you 've been clearly told that it 's an intentional gift , I do n't see any way you could be held to have done anything fraudulent if you then go about enjoying it The worst case far future problem , I would expect , is that someone decides the gift was never legitimately made in the first place In other words the company made two separate errors , first crediting the card and then telling you the erroneous points stand In that case you might have to pay them back whatever you 've spent on the card \( beyond the points you 're entitled to \) To avoid this you 'd need to establish what constitutes a binding gift in your jurisdiction , so that you can say no , the point balance was not erroneous and here 's the legal reason why , and pay them nothing You might also need to consider any tax implications in receiving such a large gift , and of course before paying tax on it \( if that 's necessary \) you 'd probably want to bug them for confirmation in writing that it really is yours If that written confirmation is n't forthcoming then so be it , they 've rescinded the gift and I doubt you 're inclined to take them to court demanding that they stand by the words of their rep Use them and play stupid It 's not my duty to check their math , right \? That 's potentially fraud or theft if you lie You did notice , and even worse they have proof you noticed since you made the call So never say you did n't notice If you had n't called them \( yet \) , then you 've been given something in error , and your jurisdiction will have an opinion on what your responsibilities are So if you had n't already called them , I would strongly suggest that you should call them or write to them about it to give them the opportunity to correct the error , or at least seek assurance that in your jurisdiction all errors in the customer 's favour are final Otherwise you 're in the position of them accidentally handing you their wallet without realising , and you deciding to keep it without telling them My guess is , that 's unlikely to be a legally binding gift , and might legally be theft or fraud on your part
0 So , the price earnings ratio is price over earnings , easy enough But obviously earnings are not static In the case of a growing company , the earnings will be higher in the future There will be extra earnings , above and beyond what the stock has right now You should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now One snag Those extra earnings are future money Future money is an interesting thing , it 's actually worth less than present money because of things like inflation , but also opportunity cost So if you bought 100 in money that you 'll have 20 years from now , you 'd expect to pay less than 100 \( The US government can sell you that money It 's called a Series EE Savings Bond and it would cost you 50 I think Do n't quote me on that , though , ask the Treasury \) So you ca n't compare future money with present money directly , and you ca n't just add those dollars to the earnings You need to compute a discount That 's what discounted cash flow analysis is about figuring out the future cash flow , and then discounting the future figuring out what it 's worth now The actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little scarier than simple division , though , because it involves discounting each year 's earnings \( in this case , someone has asserted a discount of 11 a year , and five years of earnings growth of 10 \) Wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow essentially adding all the future cash flows together , and then discounting them by a \( compounded \) rate Please forgive me for not filling this formula out I'm here for theory , not math \)

You know who owns more real wealth \? Oil does n't get bailed out , banks do , and banks ca n't innovate to save their lives , while oil innovates Hard times strengthen good companies This means that this harsh bust in commodities will separate the winners from the losers and history shows the winners do very well in the long run Related to the above point how many bailouts from tax payers do you think mining companies will get \? Zero At least you 're investing in companies that do n't steal your money through government confiscation If you 're like me , you can probably find at least 9 people out of 10 who think investing in miners is a VERY BAD idea What do they think is a good idea \? Duh , Snapchat and Twitter , bruh ! Then there 's the old saying , Be greedy when everyone 's fearful and fearful when everyone 's greedy Finally , miners own hard assets Benjamin Graham used to point this out with the dead company strategy like finding a used cigarette with one more smoke You 're getting assets cheap , while other investors are overpaying for stocks , hoping that the Fed unleashes moar QE ! Think strategy here seize cheap assets , begin limiting the supply of these assets \( if you 're the saver and not borrowing \) , then watch as the price begins to rise for them because of low supply Remember , investors are part owners in companies take more control to limit the supply Using Graham 's analogy , stock pile those one puff cigarettes for a day when there 's a low supply of cigarettes Many miners are in trouble now because they 've borrowed too much and must sell at a low profit , or in some cases , must lose When you own assets debt free , you can cut the supply This will also help the Federal Reserve , who 's been desperately trying to figure out how to raise inflation The new patriotic thing to do is stimulate the economy by sending inflation up , and limiting the supply here is key

0 This quote from the film The Devil Wears Prada pretty much sums up where fashion trends come from You think this has nothing to do with you You go to your closet and you select , I do n't know , that lumpy blue sweater , for instance , because you 're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back But what you do n't know is that that sweater is not just blue , it 's not turquoise It 's not lapis It 's actually cerulean And you 're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002 , Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent , was n't it , who showed cerulean military jackets \? I think we need a jacket here And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers And then it , uh , filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you , no doubt , fished it out of some clearance bin However , that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs , and it 's sort of comical how you think that you 've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when , in fact , you 're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff
0 Human children take around 18 21 years to reach the beginning of adulthood For all of that time at least they need love , security and support Human children reach puberty , when their bodies begin to change to adult form around 13 , sometimes earlier sometimes later With puberty comes an interest in sex , which makes babies if you are not careful ! At 13ish you have still to live just about half as long as you have already lived before or nearly 3 times as long as a five year old before you 'll be big and strong enough to look after yourself , all by yourself So when people 's bodies want to make love all the time , how can they judge if the other person is grown up enough to take care of babies for years \? Marriage is a way of everybody , the whole community of telling those people we think they are ready and we wish them all the best or of putting the brakes on when we first hear of an engagement We can say my friend , you are not ready You have to know when you announce your intention to marry that folks will support it In many cultures marriage is a negotiation between two families , the older folks who know the individuals best , to make sure that temperaments , expectations , aspirations and the like are compatible first These are the things that will count over time The young people are usually in a short term state called limerance \( URL 0 \) because their bodies are full of sex hormones and rushing towards baby making ! This means they ca n't think straight !

0 I think you 're right that from a pure expected future value perspective , it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible \( including not taking the next year 's loan \) The new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that it 's no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible The crucial point in your case , which is n't true for many people , is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly A few points to set against that , that you might want to consider Not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect , e g if the economy does badly , you have health problems , you take a career break for any reason If that happens , you would end up not being forced to pay it off , so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily The money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well Not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it , e g for a house deposit Having more free cash could increase your options , making it possible to buy a house earlier in life Or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy , reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance The savings from that could end up being more than the 6 interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate

0 There 's an interesting and slightly counter intuitive effect to how confidence , sample size , and population size work It might be tempting to think that your confidence in your statistical calculations might depend on how big your sample size as a fraction of the population being measured , and for small populations that 's a little bit true , but for larger and larger populations , that effect flattens out If you have a sock drawer containing ten socks of assorted patterns , and you pull out ten socks and count up their patterns , you can now characterize the contents of that drawer with perfect confidence You know exactly what percentage of them are striped or polka dotted If your drawer instead had eleven socks , and you pulled out ten of them , then your estimates of those percentages could be wrong , but you know it 's wrong within a pretty tight margin for error The last remaining unobserved sock could throw your estimate off by 9 in either direction If you tally up ten socks from a drawer containing twenty , then your estimates could be quite far from the actual distribution of socks Say the drawer contains 15 striped socks and 5 polka dot socks , and you somehow managed to draw all 5 polka dot socks you might look at your sample and say this drawer contains about 50 stripes and 50 polka dots And you 'd be pretty far off , because the real proportions were 75 25 But this is the farthest off you can possibly be , and it 's very unlikely that you 'd be this far off because of the unlikelihood of getting all 5 polka dot socks in your sample That 's a pretty wild coincidence But now let 's consider something a little bigger Say you want to measure the salinity of the ocean You can take an eyedropper drop of ocean water and measure its salinity , but how do you know this will be representative of the entire ocean \? After all , in the previous example you surveyed 50 of the total socks in your collection , but here , you 're only surveying a tiny fraction of a fraction of a percent of the total water in the ocean ! This might not be intuitive , but you can actually be far more confident in your estimate , based on picking just a few trillion seawater molecules out of the many many quadrillions of molecules in the ocean In this case it 's not a matter of what fraction of the total population you 're counting , it 's a case of how many individual measurements you 're taking , and the number of molecules in that one drop is a lot If the ocean were ten or a hundred times as big , it would n't matter You could be pretty much exactly as confident in your eyedropper measurement as you were before 30 is n't really a special number , but it it is a number of samples , assuming you 're drawing from an infinite population , which gives a reasonably tight error margin suitable for most research purposes
0 Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert , originally published as two separate serials in Analog magazine It tied with Roger Zelazny 's This Immortal for the Hugo Award in 1966 and it won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel It is the first installment of the Dune saga In 2003 , it was described as the world 's best selling science fiction novel Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs It tells the story of young Paul Atreides , whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland , it is the only source of melange , or spice , a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities Melange is also necessary for space navigation , which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides As melange can only be produced on Arrakis , control of the planet is a coveted and dangerous undertaking The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics , religion , ecology , technology , and human emotion , as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice Herbert wrote five sequels Dune Messiah , Children of Dune , God Emperor of Dune , Heretics of Dune , and Chapterhouse Dune Following Herbert 's death in 1986 , his son Brian Herbert and author Kevin J Anderson continued the series in over a dozen additional novels since 1999 Adaptations of the novel to cinema have been notoriously difficult and complicated In the 1970s , cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel After three years of development , the project was canceled due to a constantly growing budget In 1984 , a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to a mostly negative response from critics and failed at the box office The book was also adapted into the 2000 Sci Fi Channel miniseries Frank Herbert 's Dune and its 2003 sequel Frank Herbert 's Children of Dune \( which combines the events of Dune Messiah and Children of Dune \) A second film adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve was released on October 21 , 2021 , to generally positive reviews from critics and grossed 401 million worldwide It also went on to win six Academy Awards Villeneuve 's film was essentially the first half of the original novel , and a sequel , which will cover the remaining story , has begun production and is set for release in 2023 The series has been used as the basis for several board , role playing , and video games Since 2009 , the names of planets from the Dune novels have been adopted for the real life nomenclature of plains and other features on Saturn 's moon Titan

0 Private investors as mutual funds are a minority of the market Institutional investors make up a substantial portion of the long term holdings These include pension funds , insurance companies , and even corporations managing their money , as well as individuals rich enough to actively manage their own investments From Business Insider , with some aggregation Numbers do n't add to 100 because of rounding Also , I pulled insurance out of household because it 's not household managed Another source is the Tax Policy Center , which shows that about 50 of corporate stock is owned by individuals \( 25 \) and individually managed retirement accounts \( 25 \) Another issue is that household can be a bit confusing While some of these may be people choosing stocks and investing their money , this also includes Employee Stock Ownership Plans \( ESOP \) and company founders For example , Jeff Bezos owns about 17 of Amazon com according to Wikipedia That would show up under household even though that is not an investment account Jeff Bezos is not going to sell his company and buy equity in an index fund Anyway , the most generous description puts individuals as controlling about half of all stocks Even if they switched all of that to index funds , the other half of stocks are still owned by others In particular , about 26 is owned by institutional investors that actively manage their portfolios In addition , day traders buy and sell stocks on a daily basis , not appearing in these numbers Both active institutional investors and day traders would hop on misvalued stocks , either shorting the overvalued or buying the undervalued It does n't take that much of the market to control prices , so long as it is the active trading market The passive market does n't make frequent trades They usually only need to buy or sell as money is invested or withdrawn So while they dominate the ownership stake numbers , they are much lower on the trading volume numbers TL DR there is more than enough active investment by organizations or individuals who would not switch to index funds to offset those that do Unless that changes , this is not a big issue

0 The 3 Most Commonly Cited Factors 1 First Past The Post Voting In much of Europe , parties get seats based on what percentage of the vote they win , so a party that gets 15 of the vote will get roughly 15 of the seats Thus , smaller parties can still easily win some seats In the U S \( and the UK \) , whichever candidate wins the most votes gets the seat , and everyone else 's vote gets thrown away , making it much harder for a smaller party to win seats 2 Single Member Districts In any election , only one candidate gets a seat In Japan , something like the top 2 or 3 vote getters get seats , so more parties have a chance at being relevant 3 Electoral College This is a smaller factor , but a presidential candidate like Ross Perot seems less relevant if he wins no electoral votes than if elections were based on straight up percentage and he wins 19 of it Two Other Factors 4 Primary System In the U K , the party leadership decides which candidate gets the nomination for every race If a group does n't agree with the party leadership , they have to start their own party if they want to run If this were the case in the U S , the Republican Party for example probably would not have chosen Tea Partiers to run , and the Tea Party would have had to become its own party Because we have a primary system however , people from a wide range along the political spectrum can all run under the same party label As a corollary , smaller movements or major niche issues \( Civil Rights , Prohibition , etc \) also tend to get absorbed into one of the two major parties who are looking to broaden their support base 5 Tradition If a country only has two major parties at any one time for 200 straight years , people just get used to the idea and are at least somewhat less likely to break the status quo EDIT grammar and such

0 A photonic integrated circuit \( PIC \) or integrated optical circuit is a microchip containing two or more photonic components which form a functioning circuit This technology detects , generates , transports , and processes light Photonic integrated circuits utilize photons \( or particles of light \) as opposed to electrons that are utilized by electronic integrated circuits The major difference between the two is that a photonic integrated circuit provides functions for information signals imposed on optical wavelengths typically in the visible spectrum or near infrared \( 850 1650 nm \) The most commercially utilized material platform for photonic integrated circuits is indium phosphide \( InP \) , which allows for the integration of various optically active and passive functions on the same chip Initial examples of photonic integrated circuits were simple 2 section distributed Bragg reflector \( DBR \) lasers , consisting of two independently controlled device sections a gain section and a DBR mirror section Consequently , all modern monolithic tunable lasers , widely tunable lasers , externally modulated lasers and transmitters , integrated receivers , etc are examples of photonic integrated circuits As of 2012 , devices integrate hundreds of functions onto a single chip Pioneering work in this arena was performed at Bell Laboratories The most notable academic centers of excellence of photonic integrated circuits in InP are the University of California at Santa Barbara , USA , the Eindhoven University of Technology and the University of Twente in the Netherlands A 2005 development showed that silicon can , even though it is an indirect bandgap material , still be used to generate laser light via the Raman nonlinearity Such lasers are not electrically driven but optically driven and therefore still necessitate a further optical pump laser source

A stock market crash occurs when a major economic event causes investors to assume that all companies are going to be doing worse , and that stock prices will drop across the board as a result Not wanting to lose money , most investors will seek to sell their stock , trying to get rid of it before the 3 becomes 1 \( or even 50 or 25 \) As more people sell stock , stocks will drop in price which in turn will cause even more people to sell stock out of fear This creates a vicious cycle , which can result in millions or billions in investments being lost in just days
0 Yes it is true The US based companies have to meet the requirements placed on them by the US government The agency with all these reports is the Security and Exchange Commission They run the EDGAR system to hold all those required reports The SEC s EDGAR database provides free public access to corporate information , allowing you to quickly research a company s financial information and operations by reviewing registration statements , prospectuses and periodic reports filed on Forms 10 K and 10 Q You also can find information about recent corporate events reported on Form 8 K but that a company does not have to disclose to investors EDGAR also provides access to comment and response letters relating to disclosure filings made after August 1 , 2004 , and reviewed by either the Division of Corporation Finance or the Division of Investment Management On May 22 , 2006 , the staffs of the Divisions of Corporation Finance and Investment Management began to use the EDGAR system to issue notifications of effectiveness for Securities Act registration statements and post effective amendments , other than those that become effective automatically by law These notifications will be posted to the EDGAR system the morning after a filing is determined to be effective As pointed out by Grade 'Eh' Bacon Other countries may require different types of information to be reported to the public , in particular , financial statements To find the financial statements released for a particular company , you can go to the appropriate stock exchange , or often simply the company 's corporate website
0 mutations are random , but selection is not If you put bacteria in an environment where there 's an advantage to being immune to the anti bacterial chemical , you do n't increase the chances that a bacteria has a mutation that grants immunity BUT , you do increase the chances that a bacteria that does have that mutation will survive and out reproduce all the other bacteria \( since you killed them with the anti bacterial \) The trick , as I understand it , is that anti bacterials are effective , but there are lots of relatively simple mutations that can provide resistance As such , over use is just asking for trouble

0 Inside your computer , there is hardware literal pieces of metal with electrical currents running through them that can understand a set list of instructions Those instructions come in different electrical currents and are very simplistic add one number to another , change one pixel on your screen , etc These instructions are hard wired into the computer chips when they 're built Computer scientists call that machine language because it 's designed for the computer to understand , not for a human All the things your computer does is a result of its hardware executing those tiny , simple instructions If you wanted to , you could write any type of program in the language of those positive and negative charges In fact , that 's how all of the earliest computer programs were written ! People realized , though , that it was really hard to create complicated computer programs in such a simplistic language They needed new programming languages that were designed for humans to understand , not for computers So really smart people invented more expressive computer languages that could do in one instruction what could take dozens or hundreds in the machine language ! They then wrote a program in the machine language to transform the expressive language \( that an average human can understand \) into the simple language \( that only a computer can understand ! \) Now that we have really good expressive languages and really good programs that transform the expressive languages into machine language , very few people ever work with the machine language on a regular basis
0 Energy is needed to hold atoms together So if we find an element that does n't too much like its current configuration and wants to be in a less ' energy needy ' state , we can smash a neutron into it , breaking it However since the remaining particles have less mass than the starting particle , the excess mass becomes energy ! Uranium 235 matches that description quite well too So ! We need a bunch of U 235 , jam it into an extremely small area and fire a neutron into it Hopefully it will chain react and convert all the uranium into lighter elements leaving an amazing explosion created from energy left over Although , only a small percent of the uranium will actual undergo fission \( Fission is what we call splitting elements to put it simply \) The bomb itself will have a very set of specific parts to make sure this happens Explosive charges to compress the uranium is a main one The conditions need to be perfect for it work , you ca nt just slap it all together , it wo nt chain react fast enough So now we just made a bunch of energy in a small place , what does that mean \? This means a lot of heat Like a lot of heat Like more than the surface of the Sun hot This heats up the air , and hot gases like to expand Since this is ridiculously hot , it will expand ridiculously fast This is the blast wave which is essentially a wall of air and it will totally annihilate anything close to the bomb and will propagate outwards There is also a fireball at the center which will also destroy everything near it but its a lot more compact than the blast There is also unspent fuel which is nuclear fallout which if ingested can severely injure human beings The brightness of a the blast is also intense enough to burn you to a crisp depending on the distance Tldr Find something which can make a huge amount of energy compared to what ' you ' put in , make it react VERY quickly , the nature of gases near this thing will cause most of the damage

0 A few points The reason your lender is asking you to be above 580 is because that is the magic number for an FHA loan where your down payment would be only 3 5 \( the US Government effectively subsidizes the rest of your down pmt \) If you had a score lower than that \( but still above 500 \) , you will need to put 10 down which is still less than the typical 20 down pmt that many of us make It 's not that you ca n't get a loan with a score 580 It 's that you do n't qualify for the maximum financing thru FHA You should do some research and decide if you even want an FHA loan And keep in mind , you will throw away some money every month towards PMI \( mortgage insurance \) if you do FHA Many insist on 20 down pmt to avoid that How exactly these two items will effect your score is another question It 's possible that having accounts added back as revolving accounts could negatively not positively effect it It will likely effect it in some way and I'm not 100 which way or if it would be very significant You may want to dispute both of those items regardless if you ca n't afford anything but an FHA loan If that 's the case , then you may have nothing to lose You might also want to shop around for mortgage lenders And look for a portfolio lender These type of lenders general have more flexibility in who they can lend to and the type of loans

0 There are a couple of factors Remember that pain is a reaction in your brain \( your brain is telling you something is wrong \) , and that our sensory experience \( pain , pleasure , disgust , etc \) is moderated not just by direct sensory input \( having our pain receptors activated , tasting something , smelling something \) but also by our cognitive biases and pre conceptions There 's an old study where you give a group of people wine with either a cheap label or an expensive label , and ask them to rate the wine The people who believe they are drinking fancy wine always rate it higher than those who think the wine is cheap , despite the fact that the wine is exactly the same , since they have an expectation that expensive is better Further , if you do brain scans and look at activation of pleasure centers in the brain , the people who think the wine is fancy actually experience more pleasure In the same way , seeing a cut makes expect pain \( you know cognitively that wounds hurt \) and thus actually intensifies your pain By covering it up with a band aid , you remove this intensification That 's why shots hurt less when you look away Additionally , light pressure on an injured area reduces pain You know how you see people rubbing an injury \? The stimulation of your skin \( like from a gentle bandaid \) activates a certain type of neuron \( nerve cell \) which intercepts the signal from the neurons that sense pain Furthermore , a bandaid is protective against accidentally hitting your injured area against something and , if it at all immobilizes , can limit the motion stretching of the skin at the injured area to prevent hurting the area more

0 The first thing that it is important to note here is that the examples you have given are not individual bond prices This is what is called the generic bond price data , in effect a idealised bond with the indicated maturity period You can see individual bond prices on the UK Debt Management Office website The meaning of the various attributes \( price , yield , coupon \) remains the same , but there may be no such bond to trade in the market So let 's take the example of an actual UK Gilt , say the 4 25 Treasury Gilt 2019 The UK Debt Management Office currently lists this bond as having a maturity date of 07 Mar 2019 and a price of GBP 116 27 This means that you will pay 116 27 to purchase a bond with a nominal value of GBP 100 00 Here , the nominal price is the price that HM Treasury will buy the bond back on the maturity date Note that the title of the bond indicates a nominal yield of 4 25 This is called the coupon , so here the coupon is 4 25 In other words , the treasury will pay GBP 4 25 annually for each bond with a nominal value of GBP 100 00 Since you will now be paying a price of GBP 116 27 to purchase this bond in the market today , this means that you will be paying 116 27 to earn the nominal annual interest of 4 25 This equates to a 3 656 yield , where 3 656 4 25 116 27 It is very important to understand that the yield is not the whole story In particular , since the bond has a nominal value of GBP100 , this means that as the maturity date approaches the market price of the bond will approach the nominal price of 100 In this case , this means that you will witness a loss of capital over the period that you hold the bond If you hold the bond until maturity , then you will lose GBP 16 27 for each nominal GBP100 bond you hold When this capital loss is netted off the interest recieved , you get what is called the gross redemption yield In this case , the gross redemption yield is given as approximately 0 75 per annum NB The data table you have included clearly has errors in the pricing of the 3 month , 6 month , and 12 month generics

0 Medical terminology needs to be extremely precise to avoid deadly misunderstandings But the terminology is n't arbitrary Things are generally based on Latin or Greek root words For instance , a heart attack is a myocardial infarction Let 's break that down The muscle of the heart is known as the myocardium The myo prefix means that you 're referring to a muscle , and cardium is from the Greek word for heart What about infarction \? It 's from the Latin word infarcire , and refers to an area of dead tissue caused by a loss of blood supply So a myocarial infarction is a super specific phrase that means An area of dead heart muscle caused by a loss of blood flow That gives you a lot more information than something vague like heart attack

0 Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group \( called a cluster \) are more similar \( in some sense \) to each other than to those in other groups \( clusters \) It is a main task of exploratory data analysis , and a common technique for statistical data analysis , used in many fields , including pattern recognition , image analysis , information retrieval , bioinformatics , data compression , computer graphics and machine learning Cluster analysis itself is not one specific algorithm , but the general task to be solved It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members , dense areas of the data space , intervals or particular statistical distributions Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi objective optimization problem The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings \( including parameters such as the distance function to use , a density threshold or the number of expected clusters \) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task , but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi objective optimization that involves trial and failure It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties Besides the term clustering , there is a number of terms with similar meanings , including automatic classification , numerical taxonomy , botryology \( from Greek grape \) , typological analysis , and community detection The subtle differences are often in the use of the results while in data mining , the resulting groups are the matter of interest , in automatic classification the resulting discriminative power is of interest Cluster analysis was originated in anthropology by Driver and Kroeber in 1932 and introduced to psychology by Joseph Zubin in 1938 and Robert Tryon in 1939 and famously used by Cattell beginning in 1943 for trait theory classification in personality psychology
0 I agree that you should CONSIDER a shares based dividend income SIPP , however unless you 've done self executed trading before , enough to understand and be comfortable with it and know what you 're getting into , I would strongly suggest that as you are now near retirement , you have to appreciate that as well as the usual risks associated with markets and their constituent stocks and shares going down as well as up , there is an additional risk that you will achieve sub optimal performance because you are new to the game I took up self executed trading in 2008 \( oh yes , what a great time to learn \) and whilst I might have chosen a better time to get into it , and despite being quite successful over all , I have to say it 's the hardest thing I 've ever done ! The biggest reason it 'll be hard is emotionally , because this pension pot is all the money you 've got to live off until you die right \? So , even though you may choose safe quality stocks , when the world economy goes wrong it goes wrong , and your pension pot will still plummet , somewhat at least Unless you beat the market , something you should not expect to do if you have n't done it before , taking the rather abysmal FTSE100 as a benchmark \( all quality stocks , right \? LOL \) from last Aprils highs to this months lows , and projecting that performance forwards to the end of March , assuming you get reasonable dividends and draw out 1000 per month , your pot could be worth 164K after one year Where as with normal stable long term market performance \( i e no horrible devaluation of the market \) it could be worth 198K ! Going forwards from those 2 hypothetical positions , assuming total market stability for the rest of your life and the same reasonable dividend payouts , this one year of devaluation at the start of your pensions life is enough to reduce the time your pension pot can afford to pay out 1000 per month from 36 years to 24 years Even if every year after that devaluation is an extra 1 higher return it could still only improve to 30 years Normally of course , any stocks and shares investment is a long term investment and long term the income should be good , but pensions usually diversify into less and less risky investments as they get close to maturity , holding a certain amount of cash and bonds as well , so in my view a SIPP with stocks and shares should be AT MOST just a part of your strategy , and if you ca n't watch your pension pot payout term shrink from 26 years to 24 years hold your nerve , then maybe a SIPP with stocks and shares should be a smaller part ! When you 're dependent on your SIPP for income a market crash could cause you to make bad decisions and lose even more income All that said now , even with all the new taxes and loss of tax deductible costs , etc , I think your property idea might not be a bad one It 's just diversification at the end of the day , and that 's rarely a bad thing I really DON'T think you should consider it to be a magic bullet though , it 's not impossible to get a 10 yield from a property , but usually you wo n't I assume you 've never done buy to let before , so I would encourage you to set up a spread sheet and model it carefully If you are realistic then you should find that you have to find really REALLY exceptional properties to get that sort of return , and you wo n't find them all the time When you do your spread sheet , make sure you take into account all the one off buying costs , build a ledger effectively , so that you can plot all your costs , income and on going balance , and then see what payouts your model can afford over a reasonable number of years \( say 10 \) Take the sum of those payouts and compare them against the sum you put in to find the whole thing You must include budget for periodic minor and less frequent larger renovations \( your tenants WON'T respect your property like you would , I promise you \) , land lord insurance \( do n't omit it unless you maintain capability to access a decent reserve \( at least 10 20K say , I mean it , it 's happened to me , it cost me 10K once to fix up a place after the damage and negligence of a tenant , and it definitely could have been worse \) but I do n't really recommend you insuring yourself like this , and taking on the inherent risk \) , budget for plumber and electrician call out , or for appropriate schemes which include boiler maintenance , etc \( basically more insurance \) Also consider estate agent fees , which will be either finders fees and or 10 management fees if you do n't manage them yourself If you manage it yourself , fine , but consider the possibility that at some point someone might have to do that for you either temporarily or permanently Budget for a couple of months of vacancy every couple of years is probably prudent Do n't forget you have to pay utilities and council tax when its vacant For leaseholds do n't forget ground rent You can get a better return on investment by taking out a mortgage \( because you make money out of the underlying ROI and the mortgage APR \) \( this is usually the only way you can approach 10 yield \) but do n't forget to include the cost of mortgage fees , valuation fees , legal fees , etc , every 2 years \( or however long \) and repeat your model to make sure it is viable when interest rates go up a few percent

0 I 'll give it a shot at a scientific explanation Studies have shown that the brains of extroverts and introverts are different Introverts are found to be more sensitive to dopamine release than extroverts They tend to pay attention to small things and so details will usually stimulate introverts just as much as a new changing things Because of the sensitivity to dopamine , prolonged exposure to it is mentally draining and highly stimulating places will overload introverts You can liken it to standing next to the heater on a cold day a small heater is nice It feels really good at first with more stimuli more heaters are added and it gets comfortable With even more stimuli it 's like you 're surrounded by heaters and it becomes unbearable and you just need to get away because you ca n't stand the heat any more It 's mentally exhausting to be in a place where there is too much stimuli for a prolonged period of time The need to get away \( recharge \) that introverts feel is the need for their brain to rest from all the dopamine released They can enjoy social situations just as much as anybody can but it 's the duration that makes the difference For a comparison , people with attention disorders take amphetamines which are stimulants \( think meth or adderall \) that causes the brain to release dopamine or makes it so that dopamine does n't get reabsorbed and or allows the dopamine to be used again and again in succession The reason they seem to move nonstop and ca n't pay attention is because they are seeking new information , external stimuli , to get a release of dopamine Introverts are the opposite They need to stop receiving dopamine and to do so they need to focus on as little as possible to reduce the amount of active dopamine I 'm not a professional and I try to be as correct as I can but I might be wrong If anybody has corrections or more information to add on to this then please do so edit There probably a lot more going on but from what I 've found we know it certainly has to do with dopamine The difference is still not completely understood and people are still trying to figure it out

0 Most of compression works under a simple assumption most information is redundant or irrelevant and does n't need to be stored There are two types of compression lossless \( like ZIP files and RARs and so forth \) and lossy \( JPEG , MPEG , etc \) Lossless compression uses tricks \( like run length encoding , which people have mentioned \) to represent the same information with fewer bits It boils down to the fact that information in an easy to use format is generally pretty verbose Compression trades easy to use for easy to store Smarter lossless compressors might take into account patterns in the data For instance , a lossless compressor for English text files would probably want to take into account the frequency of various letters we use a lot of e s and not that many z s Lossy compression takes this a step further by incorporating the understanding of how the data will be used it generally takes into account that the information will be used by humans For instance , to compress a picture into a JPEG , you usually throw away a lot of the data corresponding to the color information in the photo Our eyes are much better at picking up the differences between levels of gray than we are the different colors Then we apply a variety of techniques to the data to represent it in a compact format Similarly , audio compression favors frequencies in the source audio that our ears are better at hearing One odd side effect of this is that other animals \( or aliens or whatever \) would probably look at a raw image and a JPEG and see significant differences , whereas we ca n't really perceive the difference as much

0 Steroids are chemical compounds that look like this URL 0 They are composed of four carbon rings in their core And then any other structures differentiate their biological roles There are hundreds of bioactive steroids , the most famous ones though are the steroid hormones Their characteristic is that because they are soluble in fats they easily pass the cell membrane and bind to receptors inside the cells acting directly to the DNA There are five major steroid hormone categories 1 \) Glucocorticoids 2 \) Mineralocorticoids 3 \) Estrogens 4 \) Androgens 5 \) Progestagens Glucocorticoids would be the ones that you say uncontrolled infection The main glucocorticoid would be cortisol , it mediates inflammation and immune response Chemical analogs of cortisol are frequently used as potent anti inflammatories , anti allergic and immunosuppressive drugs Mineralocorticoids control water and salt levels in the body , influencing oedema , diuresis and blood plasma volume among other things The main one would be aldosterone They are often prescribed as diuretics Estrogens well you know , what they are , they mediate female secondary sexual characteristics and menstrual cycle , they are prescribed as contraceptives most of the times Estradiol would be the main one Androgens are mediators of male secondary sexual characteristics \( muscle mass , body fat , strength etc \) That s why they are famous as performance enchanting agents Testosterone is the primary androgen Progestagens are kind of jack of all trades , they modulate and regulate the expression of all others All of the steroid hormones are also neurosteroids , meaning they have multiple , potent and very profound psychotropic functions For example testosterone generally makes someone more assertive while oestrogens more nurturing Cortisol more anxious , progesterone more calm and aldosterone more loving But all that heavily depends on other individualised factors Steroids are artificial hormones No , they are not , they occur naturally in all mammals We have created several artificial ones that mimic to varying degrees the naturals Dexomethasone is a very frequently used cortisol analog for example If you ever used a cream for sunburn you know what it is The most common type of steroid is basically testosterone No , its not The most abundant in the human body would be cholesterol , and the most commonly used in medicine would be cortisone Testosterone is basically a male thing , women have very little of it The negatives outweigh the benefits Like pretty much anything else it depends , i would n't dismiss it that fast a spike in estrogen \( due to your body trying to match test estro levels \) Estrogens are derived directly from Testostosterone so more testosterone more oestrogen BUT it ai nt that simple , androgens antagonise oestrogen 's so you might have more oestrogen but less of it could actually do something It has huge variability

0 The literal answer to your question 'what determines the price of an ETF' is 'the market' it is whatever price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept But if the market price of an ETF share deviates significantly from its NAV , the per share market value of the securities in its portfolio , then an Authorized Participant can make an arbitrage profit by a transaction \( creation or redemption \) that pushes the market price toward NAV Thus as long as the markets are operating and the APs do n't vanish in a puff of smoke we can expect price will track NAV That reduces your question to why does NAV market value of the holdings underlying a bond ETF share decrease when the market interest rate rises \? Let 's consider an example I 'll use US Treasuries because they have very active markets , are treated as risk free \( although that can be debated \) , and excluding special cases like TIPS and strips are almost perfectly fungible And I use round numbers for convenience Let 's assume the current market interest rate is 2 and 'Spindoctor 10 year Treasury Fund' opens for business with 100m invested \( via APs \) in 10 year T notes with 2 coupon at par and 1m shares issued that are worth 100 each Now assume the interest rate goes up to 3 \( this is an example NOT A PREDICTION \) no one wants to pay par for a 2 bond when they can get 3 elsewhere , so its value goes down to about 0 9 of par \( not exactly due to the way the arithmetic works but close enough \) and Spindoctor shares similarly slide to 90 At this price an investor gets slightly over 2 \( coupon face basis \) plus approximately 1 amortized capital gain \( slightly less due to time value \) per year so it 's competitive with a 3 coupon at par As you say new bonds are available that pay 3 But our fund does n't hold them we hold old bonds with a face value of 100m but a market value of only 90m If we sell those bonds now and buy 3 bonds to \( try to \) replace them , we only get 90m par value of 3 bonds , so now our fund is paying a competitive 3 but NAV is still only 90 At the other extreme , say we hold the 2 bonds to maturity , paying out only 2 interest but letting our NAV increase as the remaining term \( duration \) and thus discount of the bonds decreases assuming the market interest rate does n't change again , which for 10 years is probably unrealistic \( ignoring 2009 2016 ! \) At the end of 10 years the 2 bonds are redeemed at par and our NAV is back to 100 but from the investor 's point of view they 've forgone 10 in interest they could have received from an alternative investment over those 10 years , which is effectively an additional investment , so the original share price of 90 was correct

Not very much Nothing worth the time it would take Like you mentioned , reopening the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor In this situation , consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time This is the number one key to improving credit score So , right now , the key task is finding a new job This will enable you to make all payments on time If you pay on time and do not overspend , your credit score will be fine Can I contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least \?

Depending on how they characterize the closing of the account , it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event By negative events , I'm referring to bankruptcy , charge offs , and collections So the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30 and pay all your bills and debt payments on time \( You seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment \) As for the missing credit line and your current finances , you have to find a way forward Opening new credit account while you 're not employed is going to be very difficult , if not impossible You might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete Grocery store , fast food , wait staff , delivery driver , etc And once you get past this period of unemployment , you 'll need to catch up on all bills , then you 'll want to build your emergency fund You do n't mention one , but eating , paying rent mortgage , keeping current on bills , and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund , and the reason you need it in a liquid account Source I'm a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money , of being unemployed for periods of time , of overusing credit cards , and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings I 've done all those things and am now paying the price In order to rebuild my credit , and provide for my retirement , I'm having to work very hard to save My focus being financial health , not credit score , I 've brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red The first step was getting my payments under control I have also been watching my credit score Two years of on time mortgage payments , gradual growth of score Paid off student loans , uptick in score Opened new credit card with 0 intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts Transferred those balances Big uptick Next month when utilization on that card hits 90 , downtick that took back a year 's worth of gains However , financially , I'm not losing 50 100 a month to interest TLDR At certain times , you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things This is one of those times for you Find a job Get back on your feet Then look into living debt free , or working to achieve financial independence

0 Mortgages with a prepayment penalty usually do not charge points as a condition of issue The points , usually in the range 1 3 of the amount borrowed , are paid from the buyer 's funds at the settlement , and are effectively the prepayment penalty Once upon a time \( e g 30 years ago \) , in some areas , buyers had a choice of This last option usually had a higher interest rate than the first two It was advantageous for a buyer to accept this option if the buyer was sure that the mortgage would indeed be paid off in a short time , e g because a windfall of some kind \( huge bonus , big inheritance , a killing in the stock market , a successful IPO \) was anticipated , where the higher interest charged for only a few years did not make much of a difference Taking this third option and hanging on to the mortgage over the full 15 or 20 or 25 or 30 year term would have been a very poor choice I do not know if all three options are still available in the current mortgage market The IRS treats points for original morttgages and points for re financed mortgages differently for the purposes of Schedule A deductions Points paid on an original mortgage are deductible as mortgage interest in the year paid , whereas points paid on a refinance must be amortized over the life of the loan so that the mortgage interest deduction is the sum of the interest paid in the monthly payments plus a fraction of the points paid for the refinance The undeducted part of the points get deducted in the year that the mortgage is paid off early \( or refinanced again \) Prepayment penalties are , of course , deductible as mortgage interest in the year of the prepayment

0 I'm not entirely sure about some of the details in your question , since I think you meant to use 10 , 000 as the value of the futures contract and 3 as the value of the underlying stock Those numbers would make more sense That being said , I can give you a simple example of how to calculate the profit and loss from a leveraged futures contract For the sake of simplicity , I 'll use a well known futures contract the E mini S P500 contract Each E mini is worth 50 times the value of the S P 500 index and has a tick size of 0 25 , so the minimum price change is 0 25 50 12 50 Here 's an example Say the current value of the S P500 is 1 , 600 the value of each contract is therefore 50 1 , 600 80 , 000 You purchase one contract on margin , with an initial margin requirement1 of 5 , or 4 , 000 If the S P 500 index rises to 1 , 610 , the value of your futures contract increases to 50 1 , 610 80 , 500 Once you return the 80 , 000 4 , 000 76 , 000 that you borrowed as leverage , your profit is 80 , 500 76 , 000 4 , 500 Since you used 4 , 000 of your own funds as an initial margin , your profit , excluding commissions is 4 , 500 4 , 000 500 , which is a 500 4000 12 5 return If the index dropped to 1 , 580 , the value of your futures contract decreases to 50 1 , 580 79 , 000 After you return the 76 , 000 in leverage , you 're left with 3 , 000 , or a net loss of \( 3 , 000 4000 \) \( 4000 \) 25 The math illustrates why using leverage increases your risk , but also increases your potential for return Consider the first scenario , in which the index increases to 1 , 610 If you had forgone using margin and spent 80 , 000 of your own funds , your profit would be \( 80 , 500 80 , 000 \) 80000 625 This is smaller than your leveraged profit by a factor of 20 , the inverse of the margin requirement \( 625 05 12 5 \) In this case , the use of leverage dramatically increased your rate of return However , in the case of a decrease , you spent 80 , 000 , but gained 79 , 000 , for a loss of only 1 25 This is 20 times smaller in magnitude than your negative return when using leverage By forgoing leverage , you 've decreased your opportunity for upside , but also decreased your downside risk 1 \) For futures contracts , the margin requirements are set by the exchange , which is CME group , in the case of the E mini The 5 in my example is higher than the actual margin requirement , which is currently 3 , 850 USD per contract , but it keeps the numbers simple Also note that CME group refers to the initial margin as the performance bond instead

Bad idea You may incur penalties for returned payment , or the bank may honor the payment and charge you overdraft fees Provide to our bank the service termination notice that proves that we are not in business with the other company anymore and effectively block them However , termination notice has only our signature Bank does n't care ACH withdrawal is akin to a check The assumption is that the other side has entitlement You can put stop payment once its processed and try to reverse it claiming fraud , but the end result will be 1 you 'll end up getting a new account set up , while they try to recover the money This is one of the reasons I'm reluctant allowing standing ACH authorizations any more Generally , the American banking system is very much geared against the consumers , and in many ways is very retarded In a more advanced countries \( which is almost any other country than the US \) , the standing withdrawal authorization goes through your bank and can be revoked

0 From my understanding There are no drugs that outright increase intelligence but there are drugs supplements that can aid in memory function Explained by The term smart drugs was coined by John Morgenthaler , who coauthored two books on the subject , and unleashed a powerful meme into popular culture Over the past twenty years a whole range of new drugs , technically known as nootropics or cognitive enhancers , have been developed that improve learning and memory , problem solving abilities , verbal articulation , and even scores on standard I Q tests A substantial subculture of optimal health seekers , and self described transhumanists , have been experimenting with these substances for years , posting their reports on websites like Erowid and Bluelight , and there is a wealth of information available to anyone interested in exploring this subject Many of these drugs were initially developed to treat memory disorder problems , and age related cognitive decline , but a lot of healthy people interested in maximizing their cognitive abilities have discovered that nootropics can improve their mental performance too Nootropics are drugs , herbs , and nutritional supplements that reportedly improve mental functions , such as concentration , memory consolidation , cognition , motivation , attention , and other traits associated with intelligence The word nootropic was coined by Romanian researcher Corneliu E Giurgea in 1972 , and although the term is not meant to describe psychedelics , it literally means mind bender The word is derived from the Greek words nous \( or mind \) , and trepein \( meaning to bend or to turn \) Nootropics are thought to improve mental performance by increasing the availability of the brain s supply of neurochemicals or oxygen , by enhancing communication between different regions of the brain , or by stimulating neurogenesis , new neural growth and more dendritic connections between neurons
0 TLDR ELI5 version We have a nifty gland and system that produces and drains tears If the tears do n't evaporate on the surface of your eye or drain into your nose then they fall down your face Too lazy to search the internets yourself version There are basically three types of tears Basal tears are omnipresent in our eyes These constant tears are what keep our eyes from drying out completely The human body produces an average of 5 to 10 ounces of basal tears each day The second type is reflex tears , which serve to protect the human eye from harsh irritants such as smoke , onions or even a very strong , dusty wind To accomplish this feat , the sensory nerves in your cornea communicate this irritation to your brain stem , which in turn sends hormones to the glands in the eyelids These hormones cause the eyes to produce tears , effectively ridding them of the irritating substance The third type of tears is emotional tears It all starts in the cerebrum \( part of brain \) where sadness is registered The endocrine system is then triggered to release hormones to the ocular area , which then causes tears to form Emotional tears are common among people who see Bambi 's mother die or who suffer personal losses In fact , one study collected both reflex tears and emotional tears \( after peeling an onion and watching a sad movie , respectively \) When scientists analyzed the content of the tears , they found each type was very different Reflex tears are generally found to be about 98 percent water , whereas several chemicals are commonly present in emotional tears First is a protein called prolactin , which is also known to control breast milk production Adrenocorticotropic hormones are also common and indicate high stress levels The other chemical found in emotional tears is leucine enkephalin , an endorphin that reduces pain and works to improve mood Of course , many scientists point out that research in this area is very limited and should be further studied before any conclusion can be made The lacrimal system is made up of a secretory system , which produces tears , and an excretory system , which drains the tears The lacrimal gland is primarily responsible for producing emotional or reflexive tears As tears are produced , some fluid evaporates between blinks , and some is drained through the lacrimal punctum The tears that are drained through the punctum will eventually be drained through the nose Any excess fluid that did not go into the punctum will fall over the eyelid , which produces tears that are cried Lutz , Tom \( 1999 \) Crying the natural and cultural history of tears \( 1 ed \) New York W W Norton pp 69 70 ISBN 0 393 04756 3 \( URL 0 \)

0 To perhaps better explain the why behind this rule of thumb , first think of what it means when the P E ratio changes If the P E ratio increases , then this means the stock has become more expensive \( in relative terms \) for example , an increase in the price but no change in the earnings means you are now paying more for each cent of earnings than you previously were or , a decrease in the earnings but no change in the price means you are now paying the same for less earnings Keeping this in mind , consider what happens to the PE ratio when earnings increase \( grow \) if the price of the stock remains the same , then the stock has actually become relatively cheaper , since you are now getting more earnings for the same price All else equal , we would not expect this to happen instead , we would expect the price of the stock to increase as well proportionate to the earnings growth Therefore , a stock whose PE ratio is growing at a rate that is faster than its earnings are growing is becoming more expensive \( the price paid per cent of earnings is increasing \) Similarly , a stock whose PE ratio is growing at a slower rate than its earnings is becoming cheaper \( the price paid per cent of earnings is decreasing \) Finally , a stock whose P E ratio is growing at the same rate as its earnings are growing is retaining the same relative valuation even though the actual price of the stock may be increasing , you are paying the same amount for each cent of the underlying company 's earnings

0 In computer science , pattern matching is the act of checking a given sequence of tokens for the presence of the constituents of some pattern In contrast to pattern recognition , the match usually has to be exact either it will or will not be a match The patterns generally have the form of either sequences or tree structures Uses of pattern matching include outputting the locations \( if any \) of a pattern within a token sequence , to output some component of the matched pattern , and to substitute the matching pattern with some other token sequence \( i e , search and replace \) Sequence patterns \( e g , a text string \) are often described using regular expressions and matched using techniques such as backtracking Tree patterns are used in some programming languages as a general tool to process data based on its structure , e g C , F , Haskell , ML , Python , Ruby , Rust , Scala , Swift and the symbolic mathematics language Mathematica have special syntax for expressing tree patterns and a language construct for conditional execution and value retrieval based on it Often it is possible to give alternative patterns that are tried one by one , which yields a powerful conditional programming construct Pattern matching sometimes includes support for guards citation needed
0 In computational science , particle swarm optimization \( PSO \) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions , here dubbed particles , and moving these particles around in the search space according to simple mathematical formula over the particle 's position and velocity Each particle 's movement is influenced by its local best known position , but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search space , which are updated as better positions are found by other particles This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy , Eberhart and Shi and was first intended for simulating social behaviour , as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization The book by Kennedy and Eberhart describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli Recently , a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions Also , PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized , which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi newton methods However , metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found

0 u skeen created the r atheism sub about 5 years ago , and has been in charge so to speak since then , but he has moderated with a hands off approach , and in fact does as little moderation as humanly possible So , one of the other mods , u jij took advantage of a reddit rule that says if a moderator has been completely inactive for 60 days \( not even making a single post anywhere on reddit \) , then you can petition the reddit admins to remove them as moderators So , u jij did precisely that u skeen was removed as mod , and u jij made some new policy changes , 4 of them , although its only the first one that seems to have gotten people in an uproar image posts are not allowed to be directly linked to anymore , any image has to be submitted as a link within a self post This has effectively eliminated meme and macro posts altogether So , r atheism basically is experiencing a schism , ironically one that parallels the Protestant Catholicism schism of the Christian church one side actually preferring the new rules , claiming that more high effort content is being posted , and it vastly reduces meme karma whoring While the other side is outraged that skeen was ousted , calling it a coup and that atheist memes serve more purpose than just karma whoring And on Friday , u jij posted a poll asking users if they agreed , rejected , compromise , or abstained for the new changes 2 3rds of voters said they reject the new rules , thinking u jij would revert back to what the sub used to be like , which he has thus far not done , only adding fuel to this fire phew drama

0 This question has been asked and answered before Financially , owning a car will be more economical than leasing one in most cases The reason for this is that leasing arrangements are designed to make a profit for the leasing company over and above the value of the car A leasing company that does not profit off their customers will not be in business for long This is a zero sum game and the leasing customer is the loser The lion 's share of the customer losses are in maintenance and in the event of an accident or other damage In both cases , leasing arrangements are designed to make a large profit for the owner The average customer assumes they will never get into an accident and they underestimate the losses they will take on the maintenance For example , if both oxygen sensors need to be replaced and it would have cost you 800 to replace them yourself , but the leasing company charges you 1200 , then BOOM ! you just lost 400 If the car is totaled , the customer will lose many thousands of dollars Leasing contracts are designed to make money for the owner , not the customer Another way leasing agents make money is on required maintenance Most leasing contracts require the leasor to perform required maintenance , oil changes , tire rotations , etc Also , with newer cars manufacturers recalls are common Those are required as well Nearly nobody does this maintenance correctly This gives the agent the excuse to charge the customer thousands of dollars when the vehicle is returned Bills of 4000 to 6000 on a 3 year lease for failure to perform required maintenance are common Its items like this that allow the leasing agent to get a profit on what looks like a good deal when the customer walked in the door 3 years previously The advantage of leasing is that it costs less up front and it is more convenient to switch to a different car because you do n't have to sell the car

0 WOOOOOW literally every one of these answers are wrong H2O2 does not kill cells with a free O atom going about grabbing up different things In fact free O molecules happen all the time thanks to our Electron transport chain It just bonds with H and creates water The molecular structure of H2O2 is H O O H , with those dashes being bonds The middle bond is where the hydrogen peroxide breaks into two components producing 2 OH molecules Now OH is n't bad In fact our body is full of OH molecules Water is constantly losing and gaining hydrogen This gives a mixture in pure water of H2O molecules , HO molecules and H3O molecules This is the whole bases for the pH system \( p log 14 log H log HO \) So why does H2O2 kill \? The answer is quite radical ! \( you 'll see what I did there in a second \) When H2O2 breaks they create two OH radicals A radical is any molecule with an odd number of electrons So their is one unpaired electron in it Molecules Atoms HATE this In the body biologists call these Reactive Oxidative Species \( ROS \) Radicals will then go through radical reactions with any molecule in their way So these reactions caused by ROS are incredibly detrimental because by stealing 1 electron from another molecule the ROS stops being an ROS , but the other molecule becomes one , so the reaction is maintained All cells do have mechanisms to address this because cells do create radicals all time , but by dumping H2O2 on cells it overloads the system killing the organism

Wine Grape Varietals All wines are made from grapes There are three kinds of wines made from grapes Reds The grape skins of red wine varietals \( Grapes with red skins \) are fermented with the grape juice to get a deep red colored wine Whites Also fermented with the skins on , but made from white wine varietals \( grapes with green yellowish skins \) Ros s Usually made from red wine varietals , but the skins do not ferment in the grape juice for as long , so you get a pink wine instead of a red wine Popular Red Wine Varietals Cabernet Sauvignon Commonly referred to as the King of Wines for it 's big , bold flavors The American style Cabernet tends to be big on fruit flavors and high in tannins Merlot Similar to Cabernet , but a bit ligher in flavor and fewer tannins Merlot is often blended with Cabernet Syrah Another big wine with heavy tannins Syrahs are less fruity than Cabernet , and instead showcase more herbal and spicy flavors Good Syrahs can even taste of leather and smoke Tastes great with big , bold meats \( BBQ ! ! \) \( Syrah is also known as Shiraz when grown in Australia \) Zinfandel A fruitier and sweeter red varietal Good ' zins ' have lots of fruit \( I 've had some that taste like cherry cola ! \) along with hints of earthiness \( dirt , smoke , rocks \) Pinot Noir A red that is light on tannins \( Pinot grapes have very thin skins \) , but often bold in flavor Good Pinots often have dark fruit flavors \( plum , cherry \) , but can also be quite earthy sometimes having musty or mushroom like aromas and flavors Popular White Wine Varietals Chardonnay A versatile grape that can be made in more dry or more sweet styles The French style is more dry and lighter on the fruit , while the American style can be sweeter , frutier and have a distinctive Buttery oaky flavor Sauvignon Blanc A dry , pungent wine with sharp flavors You can often taste vegetal flavors such as grass and asparagus Pinot Gris Grigio Another popular dry white wine , notable for having a unique spiciness Muscat The grape varietal responsible for the very popular Moscato D'Asti A very sweet and perfumey wine with lower alcohol Riesling The great German varietal is said to be the most versatile food wine In addition to fruity flavors , good rieslings can taste of minerals and even have a ' petrol like ' flavor Other Interesting Wines White Zinfandel White Zinfandel is actually a Ros , made from Zinfandel grapes It is often very sweet and easy to drink , which is why wine snobs hate it Wine ' Regions ' In the US and California , wines are frequently labeled by their varietals and appellations \( Regions where the grapes are grown \) In the rest of the world \( Mainly France and Italy \) , wines are frequently labeled by their regions only For example Bordeaux Wines that are produced in France 's Bordeaux region These wines are frequently made from blends of Cabernet and Merlot , with a few other Bordeaux varietals mixed in , such as Petit Verdot and Malbec Sometimes American wineries create Bordeaux blends Meritage or Proprietary blends reds made from Bordeaux grapes American style tends to be fruitier and more tannic , while the French style tends to be less fruity , and more earthy Burgundy Wines made in France 's Burgundy region The reds are made from Pinot Noir , and the whites are made from Chardonnay Rhone France 's Rhone valley produces several wines made from Syrah Like many other varietals in the French style , Rhone valley wines are less fruity than their American counterparts Champagne Sparkling wine made in France 's Champagne region Champagne is frequently made from a blend of Chardonnay , Pinor Noir and Pinor Meunier grapes Chianti A wine made in Tuscany , Italy 's Chianti region The varietal is called Sangiovese Barolo A big , bold wine coming from Italy 's Piedmont region The varietal is called Nebbiolo Tasting Glossary Tannins Substances that cause you tongue to feel dry after drinking wine Makes you want to smack your tongue after drinking Thick skinned grapes \( Such as Cabernet and Nebbiolo \) tend to be high in tannins You can also detect tannins in other beverages such as tea Dry Not sweet In the Champagne world , Brut is the driest style Palette How flavors are perceived I get cherry and oak on the palatte The Nose How aromas are perceived I get apricots and peaches on the nose How to Taste Wine It 's generally a good idea to give freshly opened red wines some air to ' breathe ' This opens up the subtle flavors in the wine You 'll often notice the flavors of a wine change as the wine is exposed to more air Before drinking , swirl the wine , then stick your nose in the glass Give a big sniff of the aromas and try to pick out unique flavors Slurp the wine across the entire surface of the tongue , trying to incorporate as much air as possible Drink wines with food Both reds and whites can bring out unique flavors from the food , and conversely , foods can bring out unique flavors in the wine

0 Thanks to modern medicine , sex can be pretty harmless right now If you 're careful , there is very little risk of pregnancy or disease This was n't true 60 years or so ago They had condoms before then , but they were n't made from materials that were as thin or resilient as they are today , so they sucked more to use and were n't as effective So sex was dangerous , and in addition , in a pre paternity test world with a shaky understanding of pregnancy and conception , you would n't ever know if the child your wife was bearing was yours , or another man 's , unless you knew that she was a virgin until your marriage So women could n't have sex until they got married , especially if their potential husbands had any kind of inheritance to pass on to their eldest son If women mostly were n't having sex until marriage , men could n't exactly have a ton either Prostitutes have always been around , and proto condoms provided some protection against venereal disease , but it was still a risky thing to do Bringing syphilis into a marriage does n't make for too hot of a honeymoon Sure , religion helped enforce social norms but it 's not like Jesus was the first person to suggest that it was better for society for people to wait for marriage tl dr There was a world without birth control , antibiotics , and paternity tests

0 the most common reason for toes to be deformed at a young age is a tendon imbalance between the flexors and extensors of the foot for example , having a high arch or a cavus type foot , leads to the extensor tendons bowstringing and hammertoe formation Using a custom orthotic from a foot and ankle specialist may help balance deforming forces others have advocated taping the toes in an improved position but I never tape children 's toes as it potentially can strangulate the toes and cause gangrene with a certain type of flatfoot , the fourth and fifth toes turn inward due to imbalance of intrinsic tendons of the foot although these may be cosmetically unappealing I would never consider surgery until all growth plates close after around 18 years of age , and usually do n't ever cause negative symptoms

0 Disclaimer I grew up methodist Methodists and Baptists differ on a lot structural details concerning Christianity For starters , Methodist churches are typically part of a larger organization Similar to the catholic church , pastors are assigned to congregations by higher ups The congregation typically gets a sort of veto power , but in the end it means that the pastor you grew up with probably wo n't be the one you have later In fact , they typically rotate every 4 years It has it 's benefits , but also it 's downsides Baptist churches are largely more independent They choose their own pastors and it 's essentially at will employment There are Baptist organizations , but they are more for purpose of working together rather than governance This is why there are different types of Baptists \( Primative , Southern , Free Will , etc \) I was baptized when I was 14 after going through confirmation , but it 's fairly common for Methodists to baptize infants Baptists believe only adults and teens may be baptized Methodists also do n't really care how you get Baptized , as long as it happens Most do sprinkling , but some do it other ways I went to a baptism at a farm where it was done with a hose \( because it was funny \) Baptists can only do it via immersion , I think Not entirely sure , but I know they are picky about it At the more spiritual level , Baptists believe that once you are saved , you are good to go No matter what , you ca n't fall out of grace once saved Methodists believe that you can fuck it up If you get saved , but then go back to being a dickwad , you lose it Typically , Methodist teachings revolve around actions speaking louder than words for this reason In the more general and public sense , Methodists are typically not very fundamentalist My church invited a representative from Planned Parenthood to visit and talk to the youth group about safe sex and then the youth leader explained that it is important to remember that sex should be with someone you love \( he emphasized he DID NOT imply marriage \) There were gay youth leaders from other churches at the camp we went to \( Lake Junaluska , NC \) And typically , we were less concerned with the minutia Baptist , TYPICALLY , are more fundamentalist I 'm sure there are exceptions , but I do n't know of any So , there is your sorta biased response

0 CFDs \( Contracts for Difference \) are basically a contract between you and the broker on the difference in price of the underlying between the time you open a position and close a position You are not actually buying the underlying With share CFDs , the outcome is a bit like buying the underlying shares on margin You pay interest for every day you hold the CFDs overnight for long CFDs However , with short positions , you get paid interest for every day you hold your short position overnight Most people use CFDs for short term trading , however they can be used for medium to longer term trading just as you would hold a portfolio on margin What you have to remember is that because you are buying on margin you can lose more than your initial contract amount A way to manage this risk is by using position sizing and stop loses With your position sizing , if you wanted to invest 10 , 000 in a particular share trading at 10 per share , you would then buy 1000 shares or 1000 CFDs in that share Your initial expense with the CFDs might be only 1000 \( at a margin rate of 10 \) So instead of increasing your risk by having an initial outlay of 10 , 000 with the CFDs you limit your risk to the same as you were buying the shares directly
0 A falling AUD would be beneficial to exporters , and thus overall good for the economy If the economy improves and exporters start growing profits , that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase and with higher employment , employees will become more confident to make purchases , including purchasing property I feel the falling AUD will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market However , what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market , it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising With a lower AUD the RBA will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates And increasing interest rates will have a dampening effect on the housing market You are looking to buy a property to live in so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property \? I would assume at least for the medium to long term If this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet \? What you should be concerned about is that you do not overstretch on your borrowings ! Make sure you allow a buffer of 2 to 3 above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments And if you get a fixed rate then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over Regarding the doomsayers telling you that property prices are going to crash well they were saying that in 2008 , then again in 2010 , then again in 2012 I do n't know about you but I have seen no crash Sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have levelled off and maybe gone down by 10 to 15 in some areas , but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again It 's all part of the property cycle I actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price Then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices The only way there will be a property crash in Australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10 or higher But with good economic conditions , an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in Australia , I see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future Yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase , with falls up to 15 in some areas , but no crash of 40 plus As I said above , these periods of weakness actually provide opportunities to buy properties at a bit of a discount EDIT In your comments you say you intend to buy with a monthly mortgage repayment of 2500 in place of your current monthly rent of 1800 That means your loan amount would be somewhere around 550k to 600K You also mention you would be taking on a 5 year fixed rate , and look to sell in about 2 years time if you can break even \( I assume that is break even on the price you bought at \) In 2 years you would have paid 16 , 800 more on your mortgage than you would have in rent So here are the facts A better strategy

0 You will make a profit in nominal dollars \( or nominal units of whatever currency you used to buy the token \) Whether you 'll make a profit in real dollars depends on inflation , and in practice whether it would be possible to sell your existing tokens to someone else for the new price Suppose when the price was 50 U \( 50 units , since you did n't specify a currency \) , you bought one token Today you can either spend 52 U for a token , and get a liter of milk , or you can spend your existing token \( for which you paid 50 U \) and get a liter of milk It looks like you are making a profit of 2 U by spending your token However , whether that profit is real or illusory depends on what else you could do with the token For instance , suppose that , since the price of a token is now 52 U , you will have no trouble finding someone who wants to buy your token from you for 52 U If you sell your token for 52 U , you 'll still only be able to buy 1 L of milk So if you measure your wealth in milk , you have made no profit in the past you had a token representing 1 L of milk , and today you still have a token representing 1 L of milk Suppose now that in the past , when a token cost 50 U , a hamburger also cost 50 U Suppose further that a hamburger now costs 52 U So you can sell your token for 52 U , but that 52 U will still only buy you one hamburger So , again , if you measure your wealth in hamburgers , your have made no profit In the past , you could have sold your token and bought a hamburger today , you can still sell your token and buy a hamburger , and you 'll have nothing left over , so you have gained nothing If , on the other hand , the price of a hamburger today is still 50 U , then you call sell your token for 52 U , buy a hamburger for 50 U , and still have 2 U left over You have made a profit What this all goes to show is that , in practice , the idea of profit depends on the overall economy , and whether you could exchange the currency units you have in your possession for a greater quantity of goods than you could in the past Whether this is possible depends on the relative changes in price of various goods In other words , if you get your money by selling Product A , and later you buy Product B , you may or may not make a profit depending on how the prices of the two products moved relative to one another Also , in your hypothetical setup , the currency \( the token \) is directly linked to the value of a single good , so you can always at least get 1 L of milk for your token Most real currency is not bound to specific goods like your milk token , so it is possible for your currency to lose value in an absolute sense For instance , suppose you sell a book for 5 The 5 is not a book token and you cannot rely on being able to exchange it for a book in the future in the future , all books may cost 10 , and the prices of all goods may rise similarly , so your currency will actually be worth less no matter how you try to use it This could happen with the milk token if the milkman announces that henceforth 1 L of milk will cost 2 tokens your existing token suddenly loses half its value In sum , it is easy to calculate whether you made a profit in currency units What is harder is to calculate whether you made a profit in real terms \( often referred to as real dollars or inflation adjusted dollars , or the equivalent in your favorite currency \) The reason this is hard is because the idea of real dollars is fundamentally linked to the possibility of exchanging currency for goods \( and services \) , and so it depends what goods you 're buying Inflation statistics published by governments and the like use a basket of goods to approximate the overall price movements in the economy as a whole

Nope , it 's Pride and Prejudice So you know that the book you 're looking for is in the half of the shelf to your right So now you pick the middle book of the right half of the shelf Is it To Kill a Mockingbird \? Nope , it 's War and Peace , so you 've gone too far , and the book you want is somewhere between the center of the entire shelf , and the center of the right half of the shelf So next you look in the center that that area You keep repeating this until you find your book \( or discover that the book is n't there \) This is an example of a recursive algorithm Which is to say , you start by applying a binary search to the entire shelf If you do n't find what you 're looking for , you apply a binary search to one half of the shelf And then to half of that , and then to half of that , over and over until you either find what you 're looking for , or the half that you 're looking at only has one item , and it 's not the one you want

0 Been playing since launch day , I can try to sum up what I notice a lot of people have problems with Always On DRM You have to be online \( which means their servers have to be up \) to play , even when playing alone A lot of people dislike this , but now that the mad dash has pretty much subsided , outside of server maintenance , the server up time is pretty good Personally , it 's been very rare that I 've been unable to play due to server outages HUGE lack of consistency between what players thought they were getting and what they got There were TONS of leaked videos , sponsored events hinting at gameplay features , even things in the beta , that were pulled from the final release A lot of players think these features would 've helped make the game far more enjoyable Hyper Linear gameplay Pretty much the entire game is focused around a linear story There are almost no side quests outside of optional events that really bear no meaning and have little in the way of rewards You 're forced to play through the story over and over , even if all you want to do is go kill a boss to farm loot In a game that 's endgame is 100 farming , this gets old Fast It 's made worse by the fact that you 're forced to say in one section \( Act \) of the game at a time You ca n't teleport between areas in the same way you could in Diablo 2 An unspoken but very visible push by blizzard to drive users to the auction house Blizzard implemented an auction house in game for users to buy and sell gear While a great idea in theory , the execution has been terrible Blizzard takes a percentage cut of both in game gold and real money \( there are two separate auction houses , one which operates on in game money and another that works off real world cash \) Due to the obvious business desire to have players buying things off the auction house , many players feel a lot of changes are being made to push users towards the AH and away from farming \( things like nerfing popular farming routes , constant forum suggestions to go to the AH if you need better gear instead of farming it for yourself , etc \) Auction House implementation To be frank , it 's complete garbage You 're very limited in the number of attributes you can search for on your items \( you can only select 3 at a time , when any item worth buying for end game needs to match 5 6 criteria \) There are filters missing for some stats , even some that are extremely sought after , meaning you need to search through page after page of garbage gear that almost meets your needs in order to find something This comes back to the previous bullet point An earlier screenshot released prior to the launch showed a completely different AH UI that was vastly superior in every way shape and form to the one in game today , which shows that someone , somewhere down the line made the conscious decision to nerf the UI intentionally Blizzard has been extremely quiet about complaints to this effect , which is n't helping matters Blizzard patching things that seem to be far less game breaking than what the community is seeing Blizzard is fixing random bugs here or there , toying around with drop rates for end game level gear , and making minor UI changes to menus , while the AH remains untouched , the game still feels annoyingly repetitive \( even for Diablo \) , and a lot of things just feel unpolished The story Oh My God The story is awful Just , comically bad Blizzard has never been known to be the world 's best story tellers , but the cartoonish behavior of the main villians in this game just adds on to the poor voice acting , random yet utterly predictable plot turns , and pointless errand boy tasks the player is asked to perform Over all , the game was overhyped , which lead to a lot of really high expectations I have faith that Blizzard will eventually get their shit together on this \( The launch date Diablo 2 was HORRIBLE compared to what it is today \) , and nostalgia can be blamed for a lot of what players do n't like , but the game really does feel unpolished and goofy

0 There are actually several types of drugs that attack bacteria \( antibiotics \) Each type targets a specific part of the bacteria to kill it Pretty much all of these drugs actually come from bacteria though , since bacteria have been trying to kill each other for a few billion years Humans have found a few species of bacteria that produce chemicals that are good at killing bacteria but bad at killing humans , since our cells are different We refine these chemicals to make antibiotics Because this bacterial civil war has been going on for billions of years though , bacteria have evolved defenses The simplest defense is simply to have a system that pumps the antibiotic out of the bacterium fast enough that it does n't have time to work \( think pumping water out of a leaky boat \) Bacteria have also evolved systems that bind to the antibiotic This makes the drug unable to attach to its target \( think chaff confusing guided missiles \) Another way to resist antibiotics is for the bacteria to change the target Antibiotics aim for very specific parts of the cell , so even a minor change can cause resistance \( think of changing a lock \) Now , all these systems cost energy , which bacteria would rather use for other things , like reproduction So bacteria in environments that do n't have threats from antibiotics tend to not have these traits Strains grown in labs , for instance , slowly lose antibiotic resistance In any given colony of bacteria though , a few might have these traits , maybe 1 or something \( to pick an arbitrary number \) When you take an antibiotic , you kill off the susceptible bacteria , but the resistant ones survive and now have room to thrive Think of having a garden with tulips and roses A disease comes and wipes out all the tulips , but leaves the roses The garden is still there and soon it will be filled with roses Of course , it gets even worse , because bacteria can actually swap genes This is called horizontal transfer Basically , imagine next to your now rose filled garden , you have a garden of lilies Once the resistant roses meet the susceptible lilies , they become resistant lilies How do we fight this \? There are a few ways Bacteria can be resistant , but rarely immune , to antibiotics With high repeated doses , even the toughest bacteria can be killed This is why doctors and nurses always tell you take ALL of your antibiotics With very resistant bacteria , however , the doses might need to be so high they might actually cause more harm to the person than good Do n't pass around bacteria , do n't get sick The first thing any health professional does when they enter a patient 's room should be to disinfect their hands That should also be the last thing they do as well This is basically quarantining the resistant bacteria Make new drugs This is problematic , since we found all the easy chemicals decades ago In fact , starting in the 60s , research into making new antibiotics basically stopped It was n't until about 10 years ago that new types of antibiotics started to be discovered These will face the same problems of bacteria developing resistance though Try combinations of drugs Bacterial strains may have resistance to one or more types of drugs By combining different classes you can attack the bacteria on multiple fronts Still , this could lead to the growth of even more resistant bacteria if not used properly , and may have deadly side effects to the patient Infect the bacteria ! There are certain types of viruses , called bacteriophages \( or just phages \) , that infect and kill bacteria , but ignore humans There are also some bacteria that eat other bacteria \( Bdellovibrio spp is the main one we know of \) By dosing a patient with live cultures of these organisms , you can essentially use them to kill of the bacteria causing an infection Bacteria can still develop resistance to these therapies , but it 's generally easier to alter a phage to make it work again than it is to alter an antibiotic The downside is that these living antibiotics tend to be somewhat specific in what they target , doctors already need to kind of know what they 're fighting Also , your body relies on helpful bacteria to do things like digest food You need to use a phage dose that kills the harmful bacteria , but leaves the helpful bacteria alone Finally , it has to be a dose of live phages , so easy and convenient pills are out Still , phage therapy is neat The USSR actually used to be leaders in phage therapy , mostly because they could n't get antibiotics reliably from the West edit Grammar !

0 Most submarines are pressurised at basically normal atmospheric pressure , like military submarines , so the crew can work and breath just like on the surface , even if they are far underwater These subs have really strong hulls that are able to keep the enormous water pressure out , even with normal atmosphere inside These subs are usually really big , heavy , and expensive and even though they can dive pretty deep , they mostly ca n't go to the really deep places in the ocean One way to make a submarine able to dive deeper , and require a less bulky and expensive hull , is to make the air pressure inside the sub much higher than normal This means it a little bit easier for the hull to keep the water pressure out , since there is a little less difference in pressure It is of course , much harder for humans to live and breath normally in this high pressure air Different concentrations of oxygen in the air have to be used , and often the air is mixed with weird mixes of different gasses just so the people can breath in the high pressure air But if you want to dive really deep , and not have a crazy massive hull , sometimes its necessary to have high pressure inside your vehicle , so you can keep the water pressure outside from crushing your submarine

0 In mathematics , a Markov decision process \( MDP \) is a discrete time stochastic control process It provides a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker MDPs are useful for studying optimization problems solved via dynamic programming MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s a core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald Howard 's 1960 book , Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes They are used in many disciplines , including robotics , automatic control , economics and manufacturing The name of MDPs comes from the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov as they are an extension of Markov chains At each time step , the process is in some state s displaystyle s , and the decision maker may choose any action a displaystyle a that is available in state s displaystyle s The process responds at the next time step by randomly moving into a new state s displaystyle s' , and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward R a \( s , s \) displaystyle R a \( s , s' \) The probability that the process moves into its new state s displaystyle s' is influenced by the chosen action Specifically , it is given by the state transition function P a \( s , s \) displaystyle P a \( s , s' \) Thus , the next state s displaystyle s' depends on the current state s displaystyle s and the decision maker 's action a displaystyle a But given s displaystyle s and a displaystyle a , it is conditionally independent of all previous states and actions in other words , the state transitions of an MDP satisfy the Markov property Markov decision processes are an extension of Markov chains the difference is the addition of actions \( allowing choice \) and rewards \( giving motivation \) Conversely , if only one action exists for each state \( e g wait \) and all rewards are the same \( e g zero \) , a Markov decision process reduces to a Markov chain

0 I 'm not an expert , but here 's my understanding The Internet is nothing more than a large network of computers Think of a home LAN with like three computers on it , and the Internet is the exact same idea \( except much larger in scale , of course \) To connect to this network you will need to go through a provider To understand why , you have to consider the sheer size of this worldwide network and the difficulties in navigating such a large network For instance , how would you find other computers on such a large network \? That would be like me asking you to come visit my house but not giving you an address The invention of DNS helps solve this issue and is a major part of supporting the Internet today Think of DNS as a huge phonebook spread across many different servers Referring to the analogy I mentioned before , if I asked you to visit my house you could just look up my address in a directory Well , when you type in a website 's URL , the DNS does the lookup for you and sends you to the appropriate address In order to make use of the wonderful DNS , you will have to go through a provider who can take care of those operations for you Addressing the issue of navigating a large worldwide network is not something most people can do on their own , and for that reason most people can not just build a personal device to get free Internet tl dr Internet is just a large network of computers You do not have the capability to navigate such a large network alone , so you have to go through a provider who can do it for you
0 Fruit tends to be some sort of preserve so it will last longer while the yogurt is much more perishable and requires more specialized delivery systems Hence it 's cheaper to have just one yogurt delivery system Otherwise , you 'd have to have several for different mixes or only do certain flavors each day between cleaning for a different flavor The amount of fruit needed is so much smaller than yogurt it 's much easier to swap out the fruit Because some flavors are more popular than others , so it 's much easier to change the fruit than having giant tanks of pre mixed These days it 's more accurate to call it fruit separate as many have the mix on the side I prefer these as I can control how sweet fruity the yogurt ends up Things tend to be way too sweet for me for most foods in America to begin with Pre mixed is readily available , usually next to the fruit separate variety Usually cheaper , which suggests the better quality suppliers attempt to keep costs down by not pre mixing and the issues it causes
0 I am a US citizen and I want to transfer some amount 10 lakhs to my brother from my NRE account in India to his account My brother is going to purchase something for his business He is going to return my amount after 3 4 Months From the description it looks like you would like to loan to your brother on repatriation basis Yes this is allowed See the RBI Guide here and here for more details There are some conditions \( iv \) Scheme for raising loans from NRIs on repatriation basis Borrowings not exceeding US 2 , 50 , 000 or its equivalent in foreign exchange by an individual resident in India from his close relatives resident outside India , subject to the conditions that a \) the loan is free of interest b \) the minimum maturity period of the loan is seven years c \) The amount of loan is received by inward remittance in free foreign exchange through normal banking channels or by debit to the NRE FCNR account of the non resident lender d \) The loan is utilised for the borrower 's personal purposes or for carrying on his normal business activity but not for carrying on agricultural plantation activities , purchase of immovable property or shares debentures bonds issued by companies in India or for re lending Although it is mentioned as Seven years , this is revised to one year Since he cannot deposit into my NRE account I guess he has to deposit it into my NRO account A repatriate able loan as above can be deposited into NRE Account Is there any illegality here doing such transaction \?

0 There is , or will be It 's called Bitcoin But that does n't get at the question You want to know why you ca n't spend Dollars in Sochi \( you probably can this week , but we 'll get to that later \) It 's because currency has no real value by itself Currency is just a tool for keeping track of debts , a language for promise keeping , usually in the form of promises written on paper A currency is only as universal as the number of people willing to accept it in trade Anyone can create a new currency simply by writing I owe you on a scrap of paper But the note has no value beyond the trust you have for the person who wrote it This works great at a small scale , like when my brother finishes my last beer and writes a sticky note on the fridge IOU 1 brew For a national scale we need to trust strangers For a long time the best solution for this was to use valuable objects as currency Like gold That way if the promise is broken , you at least have something of value Most currencies are created and controlled by a third party , like a bank or government Our trust in those currencies is directly related to our trust in those banks countries This usually involves a safe full of gold that they use as a back up for all those promises We trust the government or bank as far as we trust their security army to keep that gold safe But why do n't currencies merge into a universal currency \? Firstly , there 's no universal third body to trust As a country , I want people to use my currency because the more my currency is used the larger my economy is , and the wealthier me and my citizens are In this way , currencies compete For the countries of Western Europe the benefits of competition were outweighed by difficulty of managing so many currencies at once , so they created the Euro Then you have Bitcoin Instead of trusting a third party , we trust each other Instead of backing the currency with gold we all have access to digital safes It eliminates the risk that the third party you were trusting might get robbed or invaded , but it demands the responsibility of not losing it yourself

0 The common core is designed to teach math in a manner consistant with how people think For instance , 17 from 52 The way I was taught to so this problem was to write 52 17 And then substract 7 from 2 , which is n't helpful , so you ' borrow ' a 10 from 50 ' and substract 7 from 12 Cross out the 5 , write a 4 in its place , and write ' 5 ' below the 7 \( 12 7 \) And so on But that 's not how we subtract naturally We think well 52 is close to 50 and 17 is close to 20 50 20 is easy 30 Then add the two you ignored from 52 32 , and the 3 you ignored going from 17 to 20 35 Each of us may choose arbitrary places to put those values \( 52 is close to 50 ' 17 is close to 15 \) but the process is the same We break hard problems down into easy problems and then add back the bits we skipped That 's part of how the common core teaches math The old way works , but students came out the other end not knowing why It produced generations of students who did math purely by cargo cult thinking

0 So , there are a bunch of excellent answers here , but I want to make it dead simple , possibly at the cost of a little accuracy Cancer cells do n't do anything useful They spread all over the body and take up space and nutrients In fact , cancer is special from other tumors because cancer tries to spread When you get too many cancer cells in one area , the normal cells ca n't get any work done , because the cancer cells are in the way Kinda like politicians , actually And when cancer spreads to an important part of the body , that part of the body stops working , and death follows In other words , if you replace cancer cells with politicians and living with passing a goddamn budget , its a pretty close analogy to U S politics nowadays

0 The two answers given previously provide excellent information In relation to your statement If I buy the above future contract , does that mean I pay 1581 90 on June 13th You cannot buy the futures contract at that price The 'price' you are seeing quoted is not a dollar value , but rather a value in points Each contract has a point value , and this varies from one contract to another according to the specifications set out by the exchange The point value is in dollars , and it therefore acts as a multiplier for the 'price' that you 've seen quoted Let 's look at an example for the E Mini S P futures These trade electronically on the Globex exchange , the ECN order book of the CME , and carry the ticker symbol ES The ES contract has a point value of 50 If the quoted price for the ES is 1581 75 , then its dollar value is 50 x 1581 75 79 , 087 50 So in order to buy this contract outright , with absolutely no use of leverage , then one theoretically requires 79 , 087 in one 's account In practice though , futures are traded on margin and so only a deposit amount is required at the time of purchase , as CQM has explained

0 One approach would be to create Journal Entries that debit asset accounts that are associated with these items and credit an Open Balance Equity account The value of these contributions would have to be worked out with an accountant , as it depends on the lesser of the adjusted basis vs the fair market value , as you then depreciate the amounts over time to take the depreciation as a business expense , and it adjusts your basis in the company \( to calculate capital gains losses when you sell \) If there were multiple partners , or your accountant wants it this way , you could then debit open balance equity and credit the owner 's contribution to a capital account in your name that represents your basis when you sell From a pure accounting perspective , if the Open Balance Equity account would zero out , you could just skip it and directly credit the capital accounts , but I prefer the Open Balance Equity as it helps know the percentages of initial equity which may influence partner ownership percentages and identify anyone who needs to contribute more to the partnership
0 LLC is , as far as I know , just a US thing , so I'm assuming that you are in the USA Update for clarification other countries do have similar concepts , but I'm not aware of any country that uses the term LLC , nor any other country that uses the single member LLC that is disregarded for income tax purposes that I'm referring to here \( and that I assume the recruiter also was talking about \) Further , LLCs vary by state I only have experience with California , so some things may not apply the same way elsewhere Also , if you are located in one state but the client is elsewhere , things can get more complex First , let 's get one thing out of the way do you want to be a contractor , or an employee \? Both have advantage , and especially in the higher income areas , contractor can be more beneficial for you Make sure that if you are a contractor , your rate must be considerably higher than as employee , to make up for the benefits you give up , as well as the FICA taxes and your expense of maintaining an LLC \( in California , it costs at least 800 year , plus legal advice , accounting , and various other fees etc \) On the other hand , oftentimes , the benefits as an employee are n't actually worth all that much when you are in high income brackets Do pay attention to health insurance that may be a valuable benefit , or it may have such high deductibles that you would be better off getting your own or paying the penalty for going uninsured Instead of a 401 \( k \) , you can set up an IRA \( update or various other options \) , and you can also replace all the other benefits If you decide that being an employee is the way to go , stop here If you decide that being a contractor is a better deal for you , then it is indeed a good idea to set up an LLC You actually have three fundamental options work as an individual \( the legal term is sole proprietorship \) , form a single member LLC disregarded for income tax purposes , or various other forms of incorporation Of these , I would argue that the single member LLC combines the best of both worlds taxation is almost the same as for sole proprietorship , the paperwork is minimal \( a lot less than any other form of incorporation \) , but it provides many of the main benefits of incorporating There are several advantages First , as others have already pointed out , the IRS and Department of Labor scrutinize contractor relationships carefully , because of companies that abused this status on a massive scale \( Uber and now defunct Homejoy , for instance , but also FedEx and other old economy companies \) One of the 20 criteria they use is whether you are incorporated or not Basically , it adds to your legal credibility as a contractor Another benefit is legal protection If your client \( or somebody else \) sues you , they can usually only sue the legal entity they are doing business with Which is the LLC Your personal assets are safe from judgments That 's why Donald Trump is still a billionaire despite his famous four bankruptcies \( which I believe were corporate , not personal , bankrupcies \) Update for clarification Some people argue that you are still liable for your personal actions You should consult with a lawyer about the details , but most business liabilities do n't arise from such acts Another commenter suggested an E O policy a very good idea , but not a substitute for an LLC An LLC does require some minimal paperwork you need to set up a separate bank account , and you will need a professional accounting system \( not an Excel spreadsheet \) But if you are a single member LLC , the paperwork is really not a huge deal you do n't need to file a separate federal tax return Your income will be treated as if it was personal income \( the technical term is that the LLC is disregarded for IRS tax purposes \) California still does require a separate tax return , but that 's only two pages or so , and unless you make a large amount , the tax is always 800 That small amount of paperwork is probably why your recruiter recommended the LLC , rather than other forms of incorporation So if you want to be a contractor , then it sounds like your recruiter gave you good advice If you want to be an employee , do n't do it A couple more points , not directly related to the question , but hopefully generally helpful If you are a contractor \( whether as sole proprietor or through an LLC \) , in most cities you need a business license Not only that , but you may even need a separate business license in every city you do business \( for instance , in the city where your client is located , even if you do n't live there \) Business licenses can range from not needed to a few dollars to a few hundred dollars In some cities , the business license fee may also depend on your income And finally , one interesting drawback of a disregarded LLC vs sole proprietorship as a contractor has to do with the W 9 form and your Social Security Number Generally , when you work for somebody and receive more than 600 year , they need to ask you for your Social Security Number , using form W 9 That is always a bit of a concern because of identity theft The IRS also recognizes a second number , the EIN \( Employer Identification Number \) This is basically like an SSN for corporations You can also apply for one if you are a sole proprietor This is a HUGE benefit because you can use the EIN in place of your SSN on the W 9 Instant identity theft protection HOWEVER , if you have a disregarded LLC , the IRS says that you MUST use your SSN you cannot use your EIN ! Update The source for that information is the W 9 instructions it specifically only excludes LLCs

0 In a process called collateralization , your mortgage is combined with others to form a security that other can invest in When done right , this process provides liquidity , more money to be lent for more loans When done wrong , bad things happen My mortgage happens to be held by the issuing bank Yours was sold into such a pool of mortgages One effect of this is the reselling of the servicing of the loan I 've had other mortgages that were sold every year , but I never paid ahead With this bank , I'm on my fifth refinance , but the bank keeps the loan in house no matter what I do n't know if there 's any correlation , it depends on the originating bank , in my opinion

0 This is a tricky question because the word invade can mean different things Can another country use covert troops in Canada if they wanted \? Sure The problem here is more on getting agents that can pass as locals If another country decided tomorrow , could they perform a traditional invasion \( think ww2 \) in Canada \? No not successfully The most important factor is the logistical capability to support the troops Canada is too far away from other countries The only country with the current logistics set up would be the United States Having said that , China could easily switch its economy to produce the logistical capabilities , but this would take time as China would need to build transport ships and planes It 's also something China does n't have much experience or planning with , so they would learn on the fly Traditionally , China has been the victim of invasions from hostile nations , so its modern day military is more focused on defense The Chinese military is broken into 4 \( i think \) quadrants and each general acts independently Russia does n't have enough logistics in place to carry out a prolonged invasion that would be required to takeover Canada Even the Russian war in Georgia showed logistical difficulties , and Georgia is right next to Russia Russian forces also have issues coordinating between their services \( air force and army \) that NATO countries have been working on improving Having said the above , both countries have nuclear weapons , so there is kind of a strategic wild card there as to how the countries could use them strategically Either country could use nukes to weaken Canada significantly , or to make Canada surrender with out an invasion \( think how US used them in Japan during ww2 \)

0 Names evolve and change and are impacted by things like different languages and different alphabets and even different pronunciations of the same alphabet in different languages To give one example , I live in Dublin , in Ireland The origins of the name are interesting Dublin has city status since 988AD , so for 1029 years now What became Dublin originally started out as a settlement near a water source The original name was in the Irish language and was Dubh Linn , meaning black pool , a reference to that water source To look at it as an English speaker Dubh Linn and Dublin have obvious similarities The Irish version is actually pronounced like Dove Ling When the British took over Ireland and started to anglicise names , it became Dublin All around Ireland there are placenames that changed to English Some are mispronunciations , some are translations of the Irish name and in some cases the name is completely new Interestingly enough , the name in the Irish language now used for Dublin is not Dubh Linn , but Baile tha Cliath , pronounced Bol ya awha clee a That was the name of another settlement close to Dubh Linn Its name translated roughly to the place at the crossing of the hurdle ford The two settlements grew , merged and eventually became what is now modern Dublin , while retaining both names Like in Baile tha Cliath , the word Baile appears in many Irish placenames It means town or place and in the Irish language is pronounced like Bol ya When names were anglicised , Baile became Bally , which again to an English speaker is a reasonable change So if you see a place starting with Bally in Ireland , it means the town of or the place of somewhere Other prefixes are common , like Kil or Kill , coming from Cill meaning church Dun coming from D n , meaning fort Knock coming from Cnoc , meaning hill There are many other similar examples So that shows you in just one country how names can change Outside of Ireland the name Dublin or something similar is used Italians tend to have vowels at the end of their words , so for them it is Dublino for example

0 AlphaFold is an artificial intelligence \( AI \) program developed by DeepMind , a subsidiary of Alphabet , which performs predictions of protein structure The program is designed as a deep learning system AlphaFold AI software has had two major versions A team of researchers that used AlphaFold 1 \( 2018 \) placed first in the overall rankings of the 13th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction \( CASP \) in December 2018 The program was particularly successful at predicting the most accurate structure for targets rated as the most difficult by the competition organisers , where no existing template structures were available from proteins with a partially similar sequence A team that used AlphaFold 2 \( 2020 \) repeated the placement in the CASP competition in November 2020 The team achieved a level of accuracy much higher than any other group It scored above 90 for around two thirds of the proteins in CASP 's global distance test \( GDT \) , a test that measures the degree to which a computational program predicted structure is similar to the lab experiment determined structure , with 100 being a complete match , within the distance cutoff used for calculating GDT AlphaFold 2 's results at CASP were described as astounding and transformational Some researchers noted that the accuracy is not high enough for a third of its predictions , and that it does not reveal the mechanism or rules of protein folding for the protein folding problem to be considered solved Nevertheless , there has been widespread respect for the technical achievement On 15 July 2021 the AlphaFold 2 paper was published at Nature as an advance access publication alongside open source software and a searchable database of species proteomes 10 11 12
0 For a human being , your body puts out x amount of BTU You maintain 98 6 degrees faranheight body heat If its 50 degrees outside but no wind is blowin there are two terms endothermic and exothermic properties what s going to happen is your body temp will drop because the air around you is colder than your body temp The air around you will heat up because you are hotter that the air around you In essence the cold air around you is stealing your heat because that s not its ideal temperature it wants to be at It wants to be warmer and it will take for weaker things like a human the problem is , there is more cold air than hot you So you will be cold stay out there lets say 5 hours and you will probably get hypothermia because 1 person can not heat an entire outdoor area , just impossible Its like 1 you fighting 4 people you may survive for an amount of time but eventually you will get beat up So , if its 50 degrees outside and the wind is blowing any amount , it will sap heat from you faster , the faster the wind the faster the sap So if its 10 mph outside at 50 degres , think of it as 5 people demolishing a house its gon na take some time to strip the house but eventually they ll do it in say , 5 days If its 50 mph wind at 50 degrees think of it as 500 peple demolishing a house they can probably do it in less than a day They just have more hands to pick apart that home the higher the wind the more likely your entire body will have a constant exposure to 50 degrees , whatever the heat exchange is , or the math After a few seconds you body simply can not compete you will get colder and probably die at some point As far as friction goes , air is not really that dense , the only way you can cause significant friction in air to heat things , you whould be moving really really fast for example when spacecraft reenters the atmosphere , they re at speeds in the 10s of thousands of MPH , that creates alot of friction and stuff gets hot the wind we experience on the ground , 20 100 mph , even 300 mph would not have that significant of friction to cause noticable heat , or at least anything above 98 6 degrees to signal it was heating up

0 These all seem above 5yo level , I 'll take a stab Electricity is generated by spinning a magnet next to a wire As the magnet moves , it pushes electrons down the wire Since a magnet has a North and a South pole , as it spins it pushes the electrons one way as one pole rotates past and pushes them the other way when the other pole rotates past So the electrons are basically sloshing back and forth , like a wave in a bathtub This is called alternating current or AC because it is not a continuous flow , rather it alternates one way and then the other We are only generating one wave so far , so we call it single phase Now say we want more power We set up another magnet and spin it too , but we time it so that it 's wave hits the end of the bathtub when the first wave it at the other end This is 2 phase power Waves that hit at the same time are in phase , our waves are at 2 different phases Want more power \? Set up three magnets , and time them so the waves all hit in sequence , 1 , 2 , 3 This is three phase power You can do this as long as you want , but typically you do n't go any higher than three phase

0 Wind changes in pressure can also affect transmission of sound waves , especially during a storm Sound is basically vibrational longitudinal waves traveling in a medium \( air \) Because they travel at different speeds depending on density pressure of the surroundings , they are subject to constructive and destructive interference depending on their trajectories This means that it can end up sounding much softer louder Resonance can also occur if the right conditions are met This results in certain frequencies ringing louder and longer than others Typically air functions like a harmonic damper \( cushion \) , which is essentially a low pass filter , cutting out higher frequencies the further you are from the source Likewise such filters are also affected by fluctuations in the medium

0 The first live television graphics \( commonly called ' supers ' or superimposement at the time \) were created at a national political convention \( iirc Republican National Convention \) in the late 60 's They were trying to figure out a way to announce the speakers without having an announcer say the name of every speaker that came up The director and technical director were at lunch at a diner that had a black menu with white letters They came up with the idea of using a luminance key to overlay the names They bought the menu and all of the letters off the diner for less than 100 and that 's how the first ' supers ' were done before computer graphics Other ways discussed in other posts were used but as far as I know that was the first Source Technical Director for 18 years EDIT Mr Hewitt swept into the early medium of TV with a series of bold editorial and technical ideas He was a leading champion of location shooting to cover spectacular breaking stories He introduced cue cards that forced anchors to look directly into the camera , only after his experiment with Braille went nowhere At the 1952 national political conventions in Chicago , he created a way of superimposing people 's names under their images on camera The idea came to him at a diner that had a menu board with rearrangeable letters When the waitress came to take his order , he replied , I 'll have the board It cost him 45 \( URL 0 \)

0 One reason might be the 100 margin requirement on long options Suppose I want to go long AAPL I could get a deep ITM call or buy shares 12 , 700 for 100 shares , with it 's 25 margin requirement is like around 3200 locked up cash Combine with a deep OTM Jan 2017 70 strike put for 188 , would give a 3400 margin requirement to enter the trade or I could be in the JAN 2017 70 strike for nearer 5800 , but with a 100 margin requirement due to being a long call So \( 3400 5800 \) 59 increase in margin requirement for Deep ITM calls Plus long term the shares will pay dividends , while a LEAP CALL does not
0 To simplify a lot The prequel trilogy shows the transition of the government of the galaxy from republic to empire , all thanks to Palpatine Darth Sidious The republic is initially governed by a senate , and Palpatine is just one senator But he wants more and he has a plan As Darth Sidious , he 's manipulating the Trade Federation \( those guys with the army of idiotic robots \) so that they threaten peace and order in the republic This scares the senate and pushes them to elect Palpatine supreme chancelor , and give him more and more special powers , supposedly as a temporary measure to resolve the crisis He 'll never give these powers back , and will instead turn the republic into an empire In short Palpatine created a disturbance with the Trade Federation , then crushed that disturbance in the name of the republic , whose senate granted him extra powers that will eventually make him emperor That 's the crux of it Politically , everything else is accessory to that For example the council \( I suppose you mean the Jedi high council \) felt it coming but failed to prevent anything As defenders of the republic , they were in Palpatine 's way to power , so he destroyed the Jedi order

0 Any sensible lender will require a lean lien against your formerly free and clear property , and will likely require an appraisal of the property The lender is free to reject the deal if the house is in any way not fitting their underwriting requirements examples of such situations would be if the house is in a flood emergency zone , in a declining area , an unusual property \( and therefore hard to compare to other properties \) , not in salable condition \( so even if they foreclose on it they 'd have a questionable ability to get their money back \) , and so forth Some lenders wo n't accept mobile homes \( manufactured housing \) as collateral , for instance , and also if the lender agrees they may also require insurance on the property to be maintained so they can ensure that a terrible fate does n't befall both properties at one time \( as happens occasionally \) On the downside , in my experience \( in the US \) lenders will often require a lower loan percentage than a comparable cash down deal An example I encountered was that the lender would happily provide 90 loan to value if a cash down payment was provided , but would not go above 75 LTV if real estate was provided instead These sort of deals are especially common in cases of new construction , where people often own the land outright and want to use it as collateral for the building of a home on that same land , but it 's not uncommon in any case \( just less common than cash down deals \) Depending on where you live and where you want to buy vs where the property you already own is located , I 'd suggest just directly talking to where you want to first consider getting a quote for financing This is not an especially exotic transaction , so the loan officer should be able to direct you if they accept such deals and what their conditions are for such arrangements On the upside , many lenders still treat the LTV to calculate their rate quote the same no matter where the down payment is coming from , with the lower the LTV the lower the interest rate they 'll be willing to quote Some lenders might not , and some might require extra closing fees you may need to shop around You might also want to get a comparative quote on getting a direct mortgage on the old property and putting the cash as down payment on the new property , thus keeping the two properties legally separate and giving you some walk away options that are n't possible otherwise I 'd advise you to talk with your lenders directly and shop around a few places and see how the two alternatives compare They might be similar , or one might be a hugely better deal ! Underwriting requirements can change quickly and can vary even within individual regions , so it 's not really possible to say once and for all which is the better way to go

0 The Guardian is a British daily newspaper It was founded in 1821 as The Manchester Guardian , and changed its name in 1959 Along with its sister papers The Observer and The Guardian Weekly , The Guardian is part of the Guardian Media Group , owned by the Scott Trust The trust was created in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of The Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of The Guardian free from commercial or political interference The trust was converted into a limited company in 2008 , with a constitution written so as to maintain for The Guardian the same protections as were built into the structure of the Scott Trust by its creators Profits are reinvested in journalism rather than distributed to owners or shareholders It is considered a newspaper of record in the UK The editor in chief Katharine Viner succeeded Alan Rusbridger in 2015 10 11 Since 2018 , the paper 's main newsprint sections have been published in tabloid format As of July 2021 update , its print edition had a daily circulation of 105 , 134 The newspaper has an online edition , TheGuardian com , as well as two international websites , Guardian Australia \( founded in 2013 \) and Guardian US \( founded in 2011 \) The paper 's readership is generally on the mainstream left of British political opinion , 12 13 and the term Guardian reader is used to imply a stereotype of liberal , left wing or politically correct views Frequent typographical errors during the age of manual typesetting led Private Eye magazine to dub the paper the Grauniad in the 1960s , a nickname still used occasionally by the editors for self mockery 14 In an Ipsos MORI research poll in September 2018 designed to interrogate the public 's trust of specific titles online , The Guardian scored highest for digital content news , with 84 of readers agreeing that they trust what they see in it 15 A December 2018 report of a poll by the Publishers Audience Measurement Company stated that the paper 's print edition was found to be the most trusted in the UK in the period from October 2017 to September 2018 It was also reported to be the most read of the UK 's quality newsbrands , including digital editions other quality brands included The Times , The Daily Telegraph , The Independent , and the i While The Guardian 's print circulation is in decline , the report indicated that news from The Guardian , including that reported online , reaches more than 23 million UK adults each month 16 Chief among the notable scoops obtained by the paper was the 2011 News International phone hacking scandal and in particular the hacking of the murdered English teenager Milly Dowler 's phone 17 The investigation led to the closure of the News of the World , the UK 's best selling Sunday newspaper and one of the highest circulation newspapers in history 18 In June 2013 , The Guardian broke news of the secret collection by the Obama administration of Verizon telephone records , 19 and subsequently revealed the existence of the surveillance program PRISM after knowledge of it was leaked to the paper by the whistleblower and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden 20 In 2016 , The Guardian led an investigation into the Panama Papers , exposing then Prime Minister David Cameron 's links to offshore bank accounts It has been named newspaper of the year four times at the annual British Press Awards most recently in 2014 , for its reporting on government surveillance 21
0 Below is just a little information on this topic from my small unique book The small stock trader The most significant non company specific factor affecting stock price is the market sentiment , while the most significant company specific factor is the earning power of the company Perhaps it would be safe to say that technical analysis is more related to psychology emotions , while fundamental analysis is more related to reason that is why it is said that fundamental analysis tells you what to trade and technical analysis tells you when to trade Thus , many stock traders use technical analysis as a timing tool for their entry and exit points Technical analysis is more suitable for short term trading and works best with large caps , for stock prices of large caps are more correlated with the general market , while small caps are more affected by company specific news and speculation Perhaps small stock traders should not waste a lot of time on fundamental analysis avoid overanalyzing the financial position , market position , and management of the focus companies It is difficult to make wise trading decisions based only on fundamental analysis \( company specific news accounts for only about 25 percent of stock price fluctuations \) There are only a few important figures and ratios to look at , such as perhaps also Furthermore , single ratios and figures do not tell much , so it is wise to use a few ratios and figures in combination You should look at their trends and also compare them with the company s main competitors and the industry average Preferably , you want to see trend improvements in these above mentioned figures and ratios , or at least some stability when the times are tough Despite all the exotic names found in technical analysis , simply put , it is the study of supply and demand for the stock , in order to predict and follow the trend Many stock traders claim stock price just represents the current supply and demand for that stock and moves to the greater side of the forces of supply and demand If you focus on a few simple small caps , perhaps you should just use the basic principles of technical analysis , such as I have no doubt that there are different ways to make money in the stock market Some may succeed purely on the basis of technical analysis , some purely due to fundamental analysis , and others from a combination of these two like most of the great stock traders have done \( Jesse Livermore , Bernard Baruch , Gerald Loeb , Nicolas Darvas , William O Neil , and Steven Cohen \) It is just a matter of finding out what best fits your personality I hope the above little information from my small unique book was a little helpful !

0 It depends on many factors , but generally , the bid ask spread will give you an idea There are typically two ways to buy \( or sell \) a security With a limit order , you would place a buy for 100 shares at 30 Then it 's easy , in the worst case you will get your 100 shares at 30 each exactly You may get lucky and have the price fall , then you will pay less than 30 Of course if the price immediately goes up to say 35 , nobody will sell at the 30 you want , so your broker will happily sit on his hands and rake in the commission while waiting on what is now a hail Mary ask With a market order , you have the problem you mention The ticker says 30 , but say after you buy the first 5 shares at 30 the price shoots up and the rest are 32 each you have now paid on average 31 9 per share This could happen because there is a limit order for 5 at 30 and 200 at 32 \( you would have filled only part of that 200 \) You would be able to see these in the order book \( sometimes shown as bid ask spread or market depth \) However , the order book is not law Just because there 's an ask for 10k shares at 35 each for your 30 X stock , does n't mean that by the time the price comes up to 35 , the offer will still be up The guy \( or algorithm \) who put it up may see the price going up and decide he now wants 40 each for his 10k shares Also , people are n't obligated to put in their order Maybe there 's a trader who intends to trade a large volume when the price hits a certain level , like a limit order , but he elected to not put in a limit order and instead watch the ticker and react in real time Then you will see a huge order suddenly come in out of nowhere So while the order book is informative , what you are asking is actually fundamentally impossible to know fully , unless you can read the minds of every interested trader As others said , in normal securities \( meaning traded at a major exchange , especially those in the S P500 \) you simply ca n't move the price , the market is too deep You would need millions of dollars to budge the price , and if you had that much money , you would n't be asking here on a QA site , you would have a professional financial advisor \( or even a team \) that specializes in distributing your large transaction over a longer time to minimize the effect on the market With crazier stocks , such as OTC and especially worthless penny stocks with market caps of 1 mil or less , what you say is a real problem \( you can end up paying multiples of the last ticker if not careful \) and you do have to be careful about it Which is why you should n't trade penny stocks unless you know what you 're doing \( and if you 're asking this question here , you do n't \)

0 Most stars we see by our naked eye are a few hundred light years away at most \( with a few at a few thousand ly \) , so by the time we see them , they have only aged a couple hundred years Since a typical main sequence star lives for at least 100 million years \( our sun will live around 10 billion years \) , it is extremely unlikely that a star will be dead by the time we see it For any given star to burn out , we will have to wait millions or billions of years , so if you estimate the number of stars in all the major constellations to be around 100 stars , we would expect to wait something like 1 100 million years before even 1 of them burns out

Obviously the company thinks that their shares are worth that much but why did the market suddenly agree \? Possibly yes , possible no It can be answered More often the rights issue are priced at slight discount to market price Why did this happen \? Obviously management thinks that the company is worth that much , but why did the market simply believe this statement without any additional information \? I do n't see any other information if the new shares had some special privileges in terms of voting rights , dividends , etc then yes However the announcements says the rights issues is for common shares

0 Speed limits on roads are determined mostly by sight lines , how quickly you can react to an obstruction and stop safely The math is well known , and for most practical road shapes the safe speed limit has already been calculated and can be looked up in a book These calculations have over time been tested and verified by standards organisations like ASTM and SAE In special cases an engineer may do a calculation to confirm what the speed limit should be if for some reason the road shape they want to use is not already tabulated , although this is rare as engineers would prefer to use a standard design to avoid the risk of something new

0 Instead of only thinking in terms of left and right politics , we can also think in terms of freedom and control There are left wing ideas that are based on valuing freedom \( legalization of drugs \) , and left wing ideas that require controlling people \( high tax strong social safety net \) There are right wing ideas that are based on valuing freedom \( legal gun ownership \) , and right wing ideas that require controlling people \( tight immigration policy \) So you can value freedom without necessarily being strongly left or right Imagine a person who strongly values individual freedom That person can see their freedom being limited from all sides , by other people who are competing with them for a share of the world 's scarce comforts Depending on how they see those limits to their freedom , they might be what you 'd call anarchist , or they might be libertarian The anarchist you 're thinking of , tends to see the business world and the government as a corrupt and amoral interconnected system , that prevents common people from living freely Anarchism literally means a lack of central control , so the anarchist thinks there should not be a government at all They might substitute that system for communal decision making , but there are many different ideas for how an anarchic society would be structured Their distrust of the capitalist game is a relatively left wing position The libertarian tends to be similarly skeptical of government , but thinks that capitalism is an expression of people 's freedom to own and trade property While the capitalist game is not perfect , it is the system that best enables the creation of wealth , they think So unlike an anarchist , a libertarian will tend to think a government is necessary , because you need a justice system to uphold property rights , and to settle disputes with minimal violence The government a libertarian wants is as small as possible , serving only to enforce those property rights , and run a national defence force This perception of absolute property rights , and of capitalism as a beneficial but tolerably imperfect game , matches up with typical right wing political views Strictly speaking , anarchism is just absolutely pro freedom , and libertarianism is a less pure kind of pro freedom that sees government as a necessary evil So alternatively you could say , anarchism says we should n't have a government , which is radical But libertarianism says let 's keep just the parts that we really ca n't do without , which is a more conservative way to think

0 Water is a liquid , obviously The way to make water go away , generally , is to get it to convert itself into its gaseous form , which is called water vapor One way to do this is obvious Wait Just wait Water naturally converts itself into a gas at room temperature through a process called evaporation But if the thing you 're trying to dry is perishable a food , say waiting is n't a great idea , because bad things will happen before the water evaporates away Another option is to add heat Hot water evaporates faster than cold water , so heating a thing will dry it out faster But again , if you 're talking about food , adding heat has side effects that might not be at all desirable Fortunately there 's a third option , and it 's neat What you do first is cool the thing until the water becomes a solid then lower the air pressure Solid water ice , in other words does something interesting when it 's exposed to low air pressure it sublimates , going from its solid form directly to its gaseous form That 's what freeze drying is in a nutshell You make a thing sufficiently cold that the water in it freezes , then you lower the air pressure until all that frozen water has sublimated away Then you raise the temperature of the thing you dried out to room temperature again , leaving yourself with something that 's all dried out

0 Whether or not you feel warm or cold when you 're touching nothing but air depends only on how warm the air right next to your skin is , because that 's the only bit of air your skin can actually feel Most of the time , in most places , the air in general will be cooler than your body , and if that bit of air next to your body stays right next to your body , your body heat will warm it up very quickly But , there 's almost always at least a little bit of wind everywhere , which means that the thin layer of air next to your body this moment is always getting blown away The faster the air moves next to our skin , the windier we think it is So , when it 's windier , each bit of air has less time to stay next to our skin So , if the air in general is cold , but it stays pretty still , the air next to our bodies has more time to warm up before being slowly blown away , when means we do n't feel as cold But , if it 's cold and windy , then the air spends much less time next to our bodies , which means it barely gets warmed up at all , so our skin is always feeling fresh , cold air that has n't been warmed at all by our body heat This is also why those big puffy winter coats , especially those very light and very puffy down jackets \( or , in a weaker way , pretty much all clothing \) , help keep us warm The down feathers in the puffy down jacket trap a lot of air in the jacket , right next to our bodies , while the outer layer blocks wind , allowing our bodies to warm up the trapped air without the air leaving So , wearing a down jacket basically lets you carry a body warmed layer of air around with you wherever you go , which makes you feel warm Finally , if the air around you is warmer than your body , then the windier that hot air feels , the hotter it feels , because your body has less time to cool it down to your own body temperature

In Western culture , two ways have found the most traction First is the way the Scandinavian cultures did it Dave , Son Of John Becomes Dave Johnson , and depending on your culture , the family is either forever named Johnson based on whoever was the patriarch when they decided to start having last names , or when Dave has a kid of his own , that kid becomes Mike Davidson and they just sort of forget about Grandpa Second is the Anglo Saxon way , which is based either on your profession or something notable about you So for example a British family might be named Cooper \( that being the old term for a guy who makes barrels \) or Baker , or Hunter , you get the idea In other languages this is still the same thing Germans have Becker \( baker \) or Schneider \( tailor \) or Richter \( judge \) , while in France you might have Brisebois \( woodcutter \) , Desjardins \( the family that 's known for the gardens \) or Lachapelle \( the chapel \) In other cultures , notably French , Spanish and Arabic , your surname is more likely to be based on where you 're from , like d'Aramitz \( from Aramitz \) , de Lugo \( from the village of Lugo \) or al Tikriti \( from Tikrit \) Often , these names will add in some middle names or ' son of 's to help tell one Saddam al Tikriti from another In short , surnames are important and here 's just one reason why \( URL 0 \)
0 Since you both are members of the LLC it is not a single member LLC , thus you have to file the tax return on behalf of the LLC \( I'm guessing you did n't elect corporate treatment , so you would be filing 1065 , which is the default \) You need to file form 4868 on behalf of yourselves as individuals , and form 7004 on behalf of the LLC as the partnership Since the LLC is disregarded \( unless you explicitly chose it not to be , which seems not to be the case \) the taxes will in fact flow to your individual return \( s \) , but the LLC will have to file the informational return on form 1065 and distribute K 1 forms to each of you So you would n't pay additional estimated taxes with the extension , as you do n't pay any taxes with the form 1065 itself If you need a help understanding all that and filling the forms do talk to a professional \( EA or CPA licensed in your state \) Also , reconsider not sending any payment I suggest sending 1 with the extension form even if you expect a refund

0 I have my safe money in index funds but like to dabble in individual stocks My criteria and thought process are usually like this , let 's use SBUX as an example Understand what the company does Also paraphrased as buy what you know A profitable growing business does n't need to be complicated Open stores Sell coffee For SBUX , my decision process literally started inside a store Rocky , why are you standing in line to overpay for coffee \? Wow , look at all these people ! I wonder if this is a good stock to buy \? Check out their fundamentals Are they profitable \? P E ratio , book value , and PEG are helpful , and I tend to use them as a gauge for whether I think the stock is overpriced or not I compare those values to others in the industry SBUX right now has a PE of 30 , which looks about average for its peers \( PEP , KKD , GMCR \) So far so good Does it pay a dividend \? This is n't necessarily good or bad , just useful to know I like dividend paying stocks , even if it means the stock price might not grow as aggressively Also , a company that pays a dividend is naturally confident in its ability to turn a profit and generate cash So it 's a safer pick , in my opinion SBUX pays a dividend , a small one , but that 's a plus for me Am I willing to watch the stock \? With my index funds , I buy and forget With my stocks , I keep an eye on the situation , read the news , and have to make a buy sell decision regularly With SBUX , I do n't watch all that closely , I just keep up with the news IMO , it 's still a buy based on all the above criteria And I feel less silly now standing in line to overpay for coffee

0 First off , you should contact your health plan administrator as soon as possible Different plans may interact differently with Medicare any advice we could provide here would be tentative at best Some of the issues you may face A person with both Medicare and a QHP would potentially have primary coverage from 2 sources Medicare and the QHP No federal law addresses this situation Under state insurance law an individual generally cannot collect full benefits from each of 2 policies that together pay more than an insured event costs State law usually specifies how insurance companies will coordinate health benefits when a person has primary coverage from more than one source In that situation , insurance companies determine which coverage is primary and which is secondary It s important to understand that a QHP is not structured to pay secondary benefits , nor are the premiums calculated or adjusted for secondary payment In addition , a person with Medicare would no longer receive any premium assistance or subsidies under the federal law While previous federal law makes it illegal for insurance companies to knowingly sell coverage that duplicates Medicare s coverage when someone is entitled to or enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B , there has been no guidance on the issue of someone who already has individual health insurance and then also enrolls in Medicare We and other consumer organizations have asked state and federal officials for clarification on this complicated situation As such , it likely is up to the plan how they choose to pay and I would n't expect them to pay much if they think they can avoid it You may also want to talk to someone at your local Medicare branch office they may know more about your state specifically or someone in your state 's department of health human services , or whomever administers the Exchanges \( if it 's not federal \) in your state Secondly , as far as enrolling for Part B , you should be aware that if she opts not to enroll in Part B at this time , if your wife later chooses to enroll before she turns 65 she will be required to pay a penalty of 10 per 12 month period she was not enrolled This will revert to 0 when she turns 65 and is then eligible under normal rules , but it will apply every year until then If she 's enrolling during the normal General Enrollment period \( Jan March \) then if she fails to enroll then she 'll be required to pay that penalty if she later enrolls if this is a Special Enrollment Period and extends beyond March , she may have the choice of enrolling next year without penalty
0 The buyer discloses the financing arrangements to the seller because it makes his offer more attractive When a seller receives and accepts an offer , the deal does not usually close until 30 to 60 days later If the buyer cannot come up with the money by closing , the deal falls apart This is a risk for the seller When a seller is considering whether or not to accept an offer , it is helpful to know the likelihood that the buyer can actually obtain the amount of cash in the offer by the closing date If the buyer ca n't acquire the funding , the offer is n't worth the paper it is printed on The amount of the down payment vs the amount of financing is also relevant to the seller Let me give you a real world example that happened to me once when I was selling a house The buyer was doing a no money down mortgage and had no money for a down payment He was even borrowing the closing costs We accepted the offer , but when the bank did the appraisal , it was short of the purchase price For most home sales , this would not be a problem , as long as the appraisal was more than the amount borrowed But in this case , because the amount borrowed was more than the appraisal , the bank had a problem The deal was at risk , and in order to continue either the buyer had to find some money somewhere \( which he could n't \) , or we had to lower the price to save the deal Certainly , accepting the offer from a buyer with no cash to bring to the table was a risk \( In our case , we got lucky We found some errors that were made in the appraisal , and got it redone \)
0 This summer I used a loan from my 401 \( k \) to help pay for the down payment of a new house We planned on selling a Condo a few months later , so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future , so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low \( spoiler alert this did n't happen \) So in July 2017 I withdrew 17 , 000 from my account \( Technically 16 , 850 00 principal and 150 processing fee \) at an effective 4 19 APR \( 4 rate and then the fee \) , with 240 scheduled payments of 86 00 \( 2 per month for 10 years \) Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was 3 , 790 , but that money would be paid back into my account I was happy with the terms , and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later But then I decided to change jobs , and ended up having to pay back the loan 20 weeks after it was issued \( using the proceeds from the sale of the condo \) During this time the market had done well , so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned \( including shares purchased with the interest payments \) was 538 25 less than today 's value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan Combined with the 150 fee , the overall cost of the 20 week loan was about 4 05 That is n't the interest rate \( interest was paid back to my account balance \) , but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn On paper , my account would be worth that much more if I had n't withdrawn the money Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks , you can think of that loan having an APR cost of around 10 5 \( Probably not valid for a multi year calculation , but seems accurate for a 12 month projection \) Again , that is not interest paid back to the account , but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account Sure , the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost , but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market It also is not something you can really schedule very well , as the loan took 6 days to fund \( not including another week of clarifying questions back forth before that \) and 10 day to repay \( from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased \) So in my experience , the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does , and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so Especially since you may be forced to do so at any time if you change jobs or your employment is terminated

0 To start off No education not college , kindergarten , pre school or high school NOTHING is free The only point of contention is who pays for it It 's generally accepted in every civilized nation that a K 12 level education is simply necessary For anything Even if your specific job does n't require it , you just need the tools of a high school education to do stuff in your daily life doing your taxes , paying bills , being able to help your kids through school they just require a certain education base Really , everyone needs that But it 's expensive Really expensive we just all agree it 's worth it Now what about college \? America typically the student pays for college out of pocket or takes debt Europe the state pays for college it 's paid through higher taxes Now neither system is explicitly better or worse than the other Again , the key point here is that education is NOT free anywhere In America There 's a lot of apt students that just ca n't pay for college they 're capable , but do n't have the opportunity because it 's too expensive Students who ca n't find good jobs when they graduate , they can easily go bankrupt for being unable to pay back their loans In Europe Too many students go to college just because it 's free and why not \? Well , this is a giant part of many European countries ' tax problems the government 's been footing the bill , and SOMEONE has to pay for it If too many people go to college and end up not using their degrees \( like if you study history or biology just to end up working in a coffee shop \) , it 's not very efficient It 's not really worth paying to overeducate people to do simple jobs , where the money could be used elsewhere But it 's not FAIR ! ! Well , people have different definitions of fair Why ca n't the government just pay for college \? Everyone should have a good education , even if they ca n't afford it I work hard for my money , why do I have to pay for everything I work hard for AND pay for other people 's college \?

0 The following is based on my Experian credit scoring feedback and experience here in the UK over many years \( And for further information I currently hold a credit score of 999 , the highest possible , with 6 credit cards \) Now I'm assuming that while there may be some differences in particulars in your case due to the difference in locality nevertheless the below should hopefully provide some broad guidelines and reasonable conclusion in your situation Having a large number of active credit accounts may be seen as a negative However having a large number of settled accounts should on the contrary have a positive effect on your score As you keep your accounts mostly settled , I think having another card will not be to your detriment and should in time be beneficial A large total credit balance outstanding may count against you \( But see the next point \) Having your total outstanding debt on all credit accounts be a smaller proportion of your total available credit , counts in your favour This means having more cards for the same amount of credit in use , is net net in your favour It also has the effect of making even larger outstanding credit balances \( as in point 2 \) to be a lower percentage of your total available credit , and consequently will indicate lower risk to lenders It appears from my experience the higher the highest credit limit on a single card you are issued \( and are managing responsibly e g either paid off or used responsibly \) the better Needless to say , any late payments count against you The best thing to do then is to set up a direct debit for the minimum amount to be paid like clockwork every month Lenders really like consistent payers \) New credit accounts initially will count against you for a while But as the accounts age and are managed responsibly or settled they will eventually count in your favour and increase your score Making many credit applications in a short space of time may count against you as you may be seen to be credit reliant Conclusion On balance I would say get the other card Your credit score might be slightly lower for a couple of months but eventually it will be to your benefit as per the above Having another card also means more flexibility and more more options if you do end up with a credit balance that you want to finance and pay off over a period as cheaply as possible In the UK the credit card companies are falling over themselves trying to offer one interest free or 0 balance transfer offers Of course they 're not truly 0 since you typically have to pay a transfer fee of a couple of percent Still , this can be quite cheap credit , much much cheaper than the headline APR rates actually associated with the cards The catch is that any additional spending on such cards are paid off first \( and attract interest at the normal rate until paid off \) Usually also if you miss a payment the interest rate reverts to the normal rate But these pitfalls are easily avoided \( pay by direct debit and do n't use card you 've got a special deal on for day to day expenses \) So , having more cards available is then very useful because you then have choice You can roll expensive debts to the cheapest lender at your disposal for as long as they 'll offer , and then simply not use that card for any purchases \( while paying off the balance as cheaply as possible \) , meanwhile using another card for day to day expenses

0 From Wikipedia Managerial accounting is used primarily by those within a company or organization Reports can be generated for any period of time such as daily , weekly or monthly Reports are considered to be future looking and have forecasting value to those within the company Financial accounting is used primarily by those outside of a company or organization Financial reports are usually created for a set period of time , such as a fiscal year or period Financial reports are historically factual and have predictive value to those who wish to make financial decisions or investments in a company At my university , managerial accounting focused more on the details of how costs were managed in the company , the future of the business , etc while the courses that were considered financial accounting were more from the point of view of a financial analyst or investor , like you said The financial accountancy material covered analysis of financial statements and the associated investment decisions , among other things These areas overlapped in areas like the production of financial statements , since the company also needs to consider how analysts will interpret these statements , and dividend policy , corporate tax accounting , etc The Wikipedia articles on managerial accounting and financial accounting may provide helpful information as well Disclaimer I took an introductory accounting course in university and nothing more , so my knowledge of the course structures , even at my alma mater , is secondhand recollection at best I'm sure there are more similarities and differences of which I'm unaware , and I would assume that forensic accountants , auditors , etc dabble in both these areas and others

0 Magnetic resonance imaging \( MRI \) is a medical imaging technique used in radiology to form pictures of the anatomy and the physiological processes of the body MRI scanners use strong magnetic fields , magnetic field gradients , and radio waves to generate images of the organs in the body MRI does not involve X rays or the use of ionizing radiation , which distinguishes it from CT and PET scans MRI is a medical application of nuclear magnetic resonance \( NMR \) which can also be used for imaging in other NMR applications , such as NMR spectroscopy MRI is widely used in hospitals and clinics for medical diagnosis , staging and follow up of disease Compared to CT , MRI provides better contrast in images of soft tissues , e g in the brain or abdomen However , it may be perceived as less comfortable by patients , due to the usually longer and louder measurements with the subject in a long , confining tube , though Open MRI designs mostly relieve this Additionally , implants and other non removable metal in the body can pose a risk and may exclude some patients from undergoing an MRI examination safely MRI was originally called NMRI \( nuclear magnetic resonance imaging \) , but nuclear was dropped to avoid negative associations Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field the resultant evolving spin polarization can induce a RF signal in a radio frequency coil and thereby be detected In clinical and research MRI , hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a macroscopic polarization that is detected by antennas close to the subject being examined Hydrogen atoms are naturally abundant in humans and other biological organisms , particularly in water and fat For this reason , most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin energy transition , and magnetic field gradients localize the polarization in space By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence , different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein Since its development in the 1970s and 1980s , MRI has proven to be a versatile imaging technique While MRI is most prominently used in diagnostic medicine and biomedical research , it also may be used to form images of non living objects , such as mummies Diffusion MRI and functional MRI extend the utility of MRI to capture neuronal tracts and blood flow respectively in the nervous system , in addition to detailed spatial images The sustained increase in demand for MRI within health systems has led to concerns about cost effectiveness and overdiagnosis dubious discuss

0 You have a few bad things that happened Once upon a time detroit was a large industrial city with plenty of work and a strong urban population This fell apart due to two main factors First , due to the rise of globalism , a lot of the industry in Detroit went away as it was outsourced to cheaper locations outside of the US \( and , notably , as US automakers lost much ground to foreign automakers \) This led to a significant decline in the well paying jobs that built the city Secondly , a significant population of the city began to move out of the city and into surrounding suburbs In most locations this is not a big deal as the city annexes surrounding suburbs In Detroit , due to some complicated legal political reasons , they could not do this The upshot is that much of the population moved to surrounding areas where taxes were now paid to the suburb rather than the city , starving the urban areas for tax revenues Starved of money with massive unemployment and many people on welfare , the city lacked funds to maintain critical infrastructure and even emergency services , which led to an increase in crime and lack of maintenance to basic services We 're talking things like not being able to keep street lights lit , slow 911 response times , not enough police or firefighters , crumbling streets , etc etc This further fed the flight of people out of the city to the suburbs , leaving primarily impoverished people \( predominantly black \) who could not afford to move as the main urban population Population declines led to numerous abandoned properties as people were foreclosed on and fled , with no one to take over the homes Entire neighborhoods ended up abandoned and crumbling The city went bankrupt and the state had to take over edit here 's a few articles with some good info on the current state of affairs and efforts to dig out there are also a surprising number of books on the decline of detroit if you 're really interested URL 0 URL 1

0 For simplicity , let 's start by just considering cash back In general , cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable , but for business use it is taxable \( sort of , I 'll explain later \) The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars you typically are n't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income , so if you purchase something that costs 100 and you receive 2 back from the CC company , effectively you have paid 98 for that item but that would n't affect your tax bill However , since businesses typically deduct most expenses , that same 100 deduction would have only been a 98 deduction for business tax purposes , so in this case the 2 should be accounted for Note , you should not consider that 2 as income though that would artificially inflate your revenue It should be treated as a negative expense , similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund Now for your specific questions Part 1 As a small business owner , I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare , hotel , and rental car Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt \? Effectively no , these expenses are not deductible If you deduct them they will be completely counter acted by the refund you receive for the payments Part 2 Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card , rather than a business credit card \? This is where it gets hairy Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards points cashback The trick is , as the employee , you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show , and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a do n't ask , do n't tell rule that the IRS is OK with It works the same way with heavy business travelers and airline miles the free vacations those users get as perks are not treated as taxable income However , I would not go out of my way to abuse this loophole Typically , things like travel \( airfare , hotel , car rental , meals \) are expected But I would n't go purchase 100 company laptops on your personal card and ask the company to reimburse you The company should purchase those 100 laptops on a company card and effectively reduce the sale price by the cashback received \( Or more realistically , negotiate a better discount with your account rep and just cut them a check \) Part 3 Would there be any difference between credit card points and brand loyalty points \? If the rental car were paid for with points earned directly on the rental car company 's loyalty system \( not a CC \) , would that yield a different result \? There is no difference Perhaps the simplest way to think about this is you can only deduct an expense that you actually incur In other words , the expense should show up on a bank or CC statement This is why when you volunteer and work 10 hours for a charity , you ca n't call that a donation of any amount of money because there is no actual payment made that would show up on a bank statement Instead you could have billed the charity for your 10 hours of work , and then turned around and donated that same amount back to them , but it ends up being a wash

0 This essentially depends on how you prefer to measure your performance I will just give a few simple examples to start Let me know if you 're looking for something more If you just want to achieve maximum return , then you should always use maximum margin , so long as your expected return \( \) is higher than your cost to borrow For example , suppose you can use margin to double your investment , and the cost to borrow is 7 If you 're investing in some security that expects to return 10 , then your annual return on an account opened with 100 is \( 2 100 10 100 7 \) 100 13 So , you see the expected return , amount of leverage , and cost to borrow will all factor in to your return Suppose you want to also account for the additional risk you 're incurring Then you could use the Sharpe Ratio For example , suppose the same security has volatility of 20 , and the risk free rate is 5 Then the Sharpe Ratio without leverage is \( 10 5 \) 20 0 25 The Sharpe Ratio using maximum margin is then \( 13 5 \) \( 2 20 \) 0 2 , where the 13 comes from the above formula So on a risk adjusted basis , it 's better not to utilize margin in this particular example
0 When you point at someone it 's usually in order to point then out to someone , which generally means you 've been discussing the person without his or her knowledge Basically , you 're talking about someone behind their back or without their knowledge \( usually saying something negative \) and now you 've brought this fact to their attention You can say rude things about someone without their knowledge , but the moment they 're aware of it , it becomes rude

0 The basis is really simple Imagine you have a computer program that will allow you to encrypt a text file or digital document by using either one of two passwords , so that once you freely choose any one of the two passwords for encrypting , then decryption can only be performed by using the other password That is you ca n't both encrypt and decrypt by using the same password once you use one of the two possible passwords for encryption , then you can only decrypt by using the other password you did not use for encrypting This is all the technical basis you need But why is this technical basis so useful \? If we use intelligently that previous technical stuff , then we can get a nice security system working This is the trick you keep one of the two passwords as a secret password only you know and no one else knows this is called your private key And you let the other password be known by everybody this will be your public key Thanks to this , you can nicely perform two interesting tasks a \) You can RECEIVE \( not send \) information in a secure manner since everybody knows your public key , then they can encrypt any information they want to send to you by using your public key Since the information has been encrypted by using your public key , then it can only be decrypted by using your private , secret key and since you are the only one who knows your own private key , then you are the only person who will be able to decrypt the information that was sent to you \( If you want to SEND information to other people in a secure manner , then you 'll have to know those people 's respective public keys , and use these public keys for encrypting \) b \) you can SEND information in such manner that you can absolutely prove that information was sent by YOU if you want to send a certain information and you encrypt it by using your PRIVATE , SECRET key , then everybody will be able to decrypt and read that information , because the information will be decryptable by your public key and everybody knows your public key So your information is not protected against reading , but , since it is decryptable by your public key , then it is a complete proof that the information was encrypted by your private , secret key And since you are the only person who knows your own private , secret key , then it gets perfectly proven that the information was encrypted by you and no one else This is why encrypting by using your own private key is also known as digitally signing the information you send Any other thing they tell you is additional unnecessary useless bullshit to make it look serious , important , only understandable by people infinitely better than you , to make you feel like a useless idiot , and to make the thing deserving of your money

0 Defendants who get such sentences have often been convicted of multiple crimes For instance , someone convicted of murder , robbery , burglary , and possessing illegal firearms may be sentenced to life \( for murder \) plus gazillion years \( for rest of the crimes \) What 's the point \? Three come to mind First , defendant may be eligible for parole , depending on the jurisdiction Let 's say that the defendant is convicted in a state where parole is possible after serving 25 years of a life sentence \( and there 's no life without the possibility of parole sentence \) The judge may think that the defendant 's crimes are so heinous that he does n't deserve to ever get out of jail The judge can issue a life sentence and tack on a long term sentence to follow consecutively to ensure that the convict will die in jail Second , a conviction can be overturned Say that our hypothetical defendant managed to get his murder conviction overturned , but still remains convicted of the other crimes By issuing a life term sentence , the judge can ensure that even if the murder conviction is overturned , the convict will have to serve out a long prison sentence Finally , the sentence can be intended to send a message to the community \( and other potential criminals \) Take for instance Bernie Madoff , who was sentenced to 150 years in jail A shorter term would have guaranteed that he will die in jail since he was over 70 when sentenced and there is no parole in the federal system But the lengthy term was meant to send a message to the community and put terror into the hearts of other would be Ponzi schemers Hope this helps !

0 Savings accounts have lower fees If you do n't anticipate doing many transactions per month , e g three or fewer withdrawals , then I would suggest a savings account rather than a checking account A joint account that requires both account holder signatures to make withdrawals will probably require both account holders' signature endorsements , in order to make deposits For example , if you are issued a tax refund by the U S Treasury , or any check that is payable to both parties , you will only be able to deposit that check in a joint account that has both persons as signatories There can be complications due to multi party account ownership if cashing versus depositing a joint check and account tax ID number When you open the account , you will need to specify what your wishes are , regarding whether both parties or either party can make deposits and withdrawals Also , at least one party will need to be present , with appropriate identification \( probably tax ID or Social Security number \) , when opening the account If the account has three or more owners , you might be required to open a business or commercial account , rather than a consumer account This would be due to the extra expense of administering an account with more than two signatories After the questioner specified interest North Carolina in the comments , I found that the North Carolina general banking statutes have specific rules for joint accounts Any two or more persons may establish a deposit account The deposit account and any balance shall be as joint tenants Unless the persons establishing the account have agreed with the bank that withdrawals require more than one signature , payment by the bank to , or on the order of \( either person on \) the account satisfys the bank 's obligation I looked for different banks in North Carolina I found joint account terms similar to this in PDF file format , everywhere , Joint Account If an item is drawn so that it is unclear whether one payee s endorsement or two is required , only one endorsement will be required and the Bank shall not be liable for any loss incurred by the maker as a result of there being only one endorsement also Joint accounts are owned by you individually or jointly with others All of the funds in a joint account may be used to repay the debts of any co owner , whether they are owed individually , by a co owner , jointly with other co owners , or jointly with other persons or entities having no interest in your account You will need to tell the bank specifically what permissions you want for your joint account , as it is between you and your bank , in North Carolina

0 Think of it like velcro The air , which in this example represents the hooks on the velcro , is moving across the water 's surface The water molecules are like felt balls , jumping around with some energy If a ball jumps high enough , and there is space for it on the velcro , it is picked up by this velcro surface If the puddle has a large surface area , meaning these balls are spread out more , rather than being stacked , the velcro can pick these up much faster because more of them can jump up and attach themselves And if the velcro is moving quickly across the surface , there 's a lot more free space for the balls to latch on , so the puddle dries up quicker But if the velcro is n't moving very fast , and there 's already a lot of felt balls attached to the velcro , the other ones ca n't latch on This is called saturation Also , if the balls are n't jumping very much because they 're not very energetic , they wo n't attach to the velcro , meaning the puddle wo n't dry up I hope this answers your question

0 These policies are usually called dread disease policies or critical illness insurance , and they normally are n't a good deal Furthermore , with the passage of the Affordable Care Act , such policies may become less common or disappear entirely These policies are n't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information , two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance When you purchase an insurance policy , the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool , e g you and your fellow employees , if you get insurance through your employer For health insurance , this average risk level is the average probability that you 'll incur healthcare costs The insurer 's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors , like your age , sex , current health , socioeconomic status , etc Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does For example , you may look like a relatively low risk individual on paper , but little does the insurance company know , BASE jumping is one of your hobbies Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company does n't , you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects If the insurance company knew this , they would like to charge you a much higher premium , if they could However , they ca n't , because a \) they do n't know about your hobby , and b \) the premium may be decided for the entire group risk pool , so they ca n't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby , you do want to take advantage of your employer 's healthcare plan Unfortunately for the insurance company , they ca n't adjust their price accordingly Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets , so I did n't go into much detail here \( too much detail is probably off topic anyway \) I can point you towards more resources on the topic if you 're interested However , the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy By expressing interest in such a specific policy , e g a cancer insurance policy , you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease In your case , you 're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it , and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness , they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it However , when you express interest in a disease specific policy , this signals the existence of asymmetric information \( your family history or other habits \) , and the insurer assumes you know something they do n't that elevates your risk level of that specific disease Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies , the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them They can charge you a higher premium because you 've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above average risk of contracting a specific disease Also , the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease The policy will be priced accordingly , i e in such a way that is n't necessarily beneficial to you Furthermore , most dread disease policies are n't guaranteed renewable , which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums , the insurance company does n't have to keep insuring you As your risk of developing the specific disease grows , e g with age , it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles , so they decide not to renew your policy The end result \? The insurance company has the premiums you 've paid previously , but you no longer have coverage for that illness , and ex post , you 've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act According to healthcare gov Starting in 2014 , all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses , and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges , must include a range of essential health benefits The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it , dread disease policies would n't seem to qualify For more information , you can read the linked page on healthcare gov or see Section 1302 , subsection b \) , titled Essential Health Benefits Requirements in the law itself \( p87 \) I imagine more details will be available on a state by state basis through 2014 and into 2015 One legal source \( see the discussion on p24 \) states that whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies , including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies , it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward a dread disease \( or specific disease policy , as it 's referred to in the article \) , wo n't count towards the minimum essential requirements This may not be an issue for you , but for others , it 's important to understand that you 'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies The ACA spells this out in Section 5000 \( f \) \( see p316 , which states that excepted benefit policies are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act \( PHSA \) The PSHA specifically includes Coverage only for a specified disease or illness in their definition of excepted benefit policies \( see section 2791 \( b \) , paragraph 3A on p82 , so it 's probably a safe bet that such policies wo n't count towards the minimum Also , as Rick pointed out in the comments , the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans , so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you 're worried about , such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit Deductibles , annual limits , and other factors may complicate this somewhat In the section about lifetime limits \( Sec 2711 , p2 \) , the Affordable Care Act states that A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary However , the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302 \( b \) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act , to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits , so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law 's implementation is left up to individual states Furthermore , certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services , so these may require further codification in the future too You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract \( see the next section \) Since a dread disease policy probably is n't a good idea , you 'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area \( if your employer does n't offer coverage \) I 've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented , so I 'll try to keep them as general as possible Services Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements , what services does the plan offer \? Are these services a good match for you and or your family , or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit \? For example , my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co pay , so I do n't need a separate dental plan , even though my employer offers one Choice What doctors , clinics , hospitals , etc are preferred providers under your plan \? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist , or can you find one on your own \? Are the preferred providers convenient for you \? In my first year of college \( about five years ago \) , my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach This is something to keep in mind , depending on where you live Costs This is a major one , obviously Deductibles , copays , maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime , out of network costs , etc are all variables to consider There are other factors , but since I do n't have a family , other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies In place of a dread disease policy , you 're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy , perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you 've exhausted your standard insurance policy However , this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway

0 Let 's say you and your best friend decide to be naughty and plan to steal some tasty candy from the teacher 's bowl When she 's not looking , you two sneak up for the take , but get caught and are sent to the principal 's office The two of you are separated , you ca n't talk to each other at all , ca n't pass notes or anything like that The principal tells you that they really only want to punish whoever came up with the idea , and that if you give up your friend , and say it was all his idea , he 'll get a month of time out during recess and you get no punishment But , if you do n't say anything at all , they 'll put you in time out for 1 day for making mischief You 're not going to give up your friend that easily , so you refuse The principal then tells you that your friend has been given the same option , and if he gives you up but you do n't say anything , they 'll assume it was all your idea and YOU get 1 month of time out If you both give up the other , he will punish you both with 3 days of time out for lying So what do you do , knowing that your friend , as smart as you are , has the same options in front of him \?

0 It just is It 's not a satisfying answer , but it 's the right one It might seem logical that the visual cortex would be as close to the eyes as possible , but if there was an evolutionary disadvantage to having the visual cortex at the back of the brain instead of near the eyes , it would n't be that way The fact that the visual cortex is where it is shows that there 's no disadvantage to having it in the back of the brain In addition , it is not the case that fibers are not just running from the eyes all the way back to the visual cortex there are additional targets for the signals from the retina besides the visual cortex And even for signals that end up a the visual cortex , there is quite a bit of processing that happens along they way in other parts of the brain before reaching the visual cortex

0 The definition is fuzzy , but a film noir movie usually is a crime drama has cynical and often morally ambivalent characters , where the heros and villains are not all the different film techniques involving low lighting and off balanced composition , often resulting in a gritty , stylized ugliness that makes the more seem more real , even if the plot itself is fanciful Perhaps it is easier to define noir by what it is not During its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s , movies were often shallow and formulaic , with a dashing , morally certain hero who always did the right thing saving the fair damsel in distress from the clutches of the mustache twirling villain Film noir was a rejection of this simplistic world view that sought to portray the ugliness and moral ambiguity of the world

0 Inflation is n't always certain , but it usually happens because countries usually try to maintain low rates of inflation for their economies Low inflation rates are generally preferred because they encourage investment without making people 's current savings worthless Inflation encourages investment because money sitting in a bank account loses value when there 's inflation If money sitting in a bank loses value , people are more likely to invest it somewhere where the money can grow steadily Deflation discourages investment because your money will increase in value by just existing Why risk investing in anything if your money is going to become more valuable over time anyway \?

0 Association rule learning is a rule based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness In any given transaction with a variety of items , association rules are meant to discover the rules that determine how or why certain items are connected Based on the concept of strong rules , Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieli ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point of sale \( POS \) systems in supermarkets For example , the rule o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s b u r g e r displaystyle mathrm onions , potatoes Rightarrow mathrm burger found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together , they are likely to also buy hamburger meat Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as , e g , promotional pricing or product placements In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , and bioinformatics In contrast with sequence mining , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions The association rule algorithm itself consists of various parameters that can make it difficult for those without some expertise in data mining to execute , with many rules that are arduous to understand

0 I 've worked at silicon valley startups for 10 years and I can tell you , with my hand on my heart that the numbers for early seed rounds are basically made up I mean , there 's a logic at play but it 's based on what you 're able to raise to deliver a prototype of your vision If you have an idea for umbrella drones you spec out your engineering cost to build the devices and a fabrication facility , then you need to hire people so you cost out those salaries , you need office space and marketing etc and you arrive at a number Call it 2mn Then you start meeting investors , you give them your pitch which will go something like there 's 3bn people affected by rain every year , and 1 8bn buy umbrellas every year , which creates an umbrella market worth 4tn year We believe we can produce and sell 120k 1000 drone umbrellas year at a market cap of 120mn , we 're looking to raise 2mn in return for 5 as a series A etc etc \( i 'm being flippant , but you get the idea \) Investors want to give the least amount of money for the most return at the lowest risk , so they tend to partner up with other Angels or VC companies So 1 investor might give 100k and someone else might give 500k , but each of those transactions will establish a value based solely on the cost of producing the initial idea \( and frequently , just a prototype version of the idea \) and the founders ability to sell his pitch Investors also like to call the shots , so while the founder wants to execute his vision , he still has to go and report back to the VCs on progress \( usually via board meetings \) , if the company is not growing fast enough , or the VCs have started seeing trends in other sectors that will yield a safer return , they can and frequently do , make strategy changes they expect the company to embrace The founder is free to ignore the request , but he wo n't get another round of investment from that investor Profit is rarely a factor in the equation Everyone wants a profitable company but companies can operate solely by raising cash , and they raise cash by talking about their appeal and using metrics that verify their appeal , ie how many users , 40 year on year growth , subscriber penetration , repeat visits , unique impressions etc It 's why twitter , a company that makes almost no money , is worth 7bn It 's madness when you think about it Once that initial investment is raised , a public valuation now exists and all subsequent valuations are essentially an evolution of it
0 In computability theory , the Church Turing thesis \( also known as computability thesis , the Turing Church thesis , the Church Turing conjecture , Church 's thesis , Church 's conjecture , and Turing 's thesis \) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a Turing machine The thesis is named after American mathematician Alonzo Church and the British mathematician Alan Turing Before the precise definition of computable function , mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable to describe functions that are computable by paper and pencil methods In the 1930s , several independent attempts were made to formalize the notion of computability Church , Kleene , and Turing 11 proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide a function is computable if and only if it is Turing computable , and if and only if it is general recursive This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief \( see below \) On the other hand , the Church Turing thesis states that the above three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide with the informal notion of an effectively calculable function Although the thesis has near universal acceptance , it cannot be formally proven , as the concept of effective calculability is only informally defined Since its inception , variations on the original thesis have arisen , including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe \( physical Church Turing thesis \) and what can be efficiently computed \( Church Turing thesis \( complexity theory \) \) These variations are not due to Church or Turing , but arise from later work in complexity theory and digital physics The thesis also has implications for the philosophy of mind \( see below \)

0 The 20 returns you have observed in the mutual funds are not free money They are compensation for the risk associated with owning those funds Given the extraordinarily high returns you are seeing I would expect extremely high risk This means there is a good possibility of extreme losses at some point By putting a lot of money in those mutual funds you are taking a gamble that may or may not pay off Assuming what your friend is paying you for rent is fair , you are not losing money on your house relative to the market You are earning less because you are invested in a less risky asset If you want a higher return , you should borrow some money \( or sell your house \) and invest in the market You may make more money that way But if you do that , you will have a larger chance of losing a lot of money at some point That 's the way risk works No one can promise a 20 return on a risky asset , they can only hint that it may do in the future what it did in the past A reasonable approach to investment is to get invested in lots of different things stocks , bonds , real estate If you are afraid of risk and willing to earn less , keep more money in safe assets If you are willing to take big risks in exchange for the possibility of high returns , move more assets into risky stuff If you want extreme returns and are willing to take extreme risk , borrow and use the money to invest in risky assets As you look over investment options , remember that anything that pays high returns most likely has high risk as well

0 In cryptography , a brute force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found Alternatively , the attacker can attempt to guess the key which is typically created from the password using a key derivation function This is known as an exhaustive key search A brute force attack is a cryptanalytic attack that can , in theory , be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data \( except for data encrypted in an information theoretically secure manner \) Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system \( if any exist \) that would make the task easier When password guessing , this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords , but for longer passwords other methods such as the dictionary attack are used because a brute force search takes too long Longer passwords , passphrases and keys have more possible values , making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones Brute force attacks can be made less effective by obfuscating the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute force attack against it Brute force attacks are an application of brute force search , the general problem solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one The word 'hammering' is sometimes used to describe a brute force attack , with 'anti hammering' for countermeasures

0 The immediate cause Several states whose economies were based on agriculture via slave labor attempted to leave the nation upon the election of Abraham Lincoln Lincoln had vocally opposed slavery being legal in any future states , which would mean that slave states would eventually be outnumbered in the legislature The new states attacked a government fort on their territory , which led to Lincoln sending troops , which led to several more states who had been on the fence seeing war as inevitable and also attempting to leave the U S \( I say attempting in that they ultimately did n't succeed the Confederacy certainly functioned as a nation for several years \) The long version involves the centuries of slave trading , the growing divide between the mostly agricultural South and increasingly industrial North , and the fundamental argument of whether states or the national government had the final say The long version has filled many , many books

0 Assuming USA It is possible to make the interest deductible if you go to the trouble of structuring , and filing , the loan as an actual mortgage on a primary residence Websearching intra family loan will find several firms which specialize in this It costs about 700 for all the paperwork and filing fees as of last time I checked , so unless you 're going to pay at least three times that in interest over the life of the loan it probably is n't worth considering \( For an additional fee they 'll take care of the payment processing , if you 'd really rather be hands off about it \) I have no idea whether the paperwork fees and processing fees can be deducted from the interest as a cost of producing that income In theory that ought to be true , but I Am Not A Lawyer Or accountant Note one of the interesting factors here is that the IRS sets a minimum interest rate on intra family loans It 's pretty low \( around 0 3 \) , so in most cases you can say you gifted the difference if you 'd prefer to charge less but that does set a floor on what the IRS will expect the lender to declare , and pay taxes on There 's a lot more that can be said about this , but since I am NOT an expert I 'll refer you to those who are I have no affiliation with any of this except as a customer , once it seemed pretty painless but I ca n't claim to know whether they were really handling everything exactly correctly The website seemed to do a pretty good job of explaining what choices had to be made and their effects , as well as discussing how these can be used to avoid excess gift taxes by spreading the gift over a number of years

0 At first , I thought this might be too broad There are of course thousands of things that you can do with your money to help the economy But I think that there is room to discuss some broad strokes without trying to list a thousand details Regular investing \( as you are now \) helps the economy in that companies obtain money by selling their stock They can then use that money to fund expansion , etc These things can help the economy permanently Of course , they can also use the money to pay executive bonuses , which do n't help the economy so much Similarly , just spending money does not normally help the economy Unless we are in a recession , it is mildly harmful to spend wastefully Money that could be going to support long term improvements in production instead is used to buy a luxury that does n't terribly interest you I e if you do n't want a bigger house or a more luxurious car do n't buy it to stimulate the economy Many charitable donations have the same problem They help short term consumption somewhere And of course the charity starts asking you for more money Many charities waste most of a donation trying to get another one from the same person or family Sir John Maynard Keynes proposed that the best thing that people could do to help the economy is to invest in things that cause economic activity in turn He was mostly talking about things like roads , bridges , and dams that are out of the investing range of most people , so he wanted governments to do it , particularly during a recession So we are looking for ways to invest in durable improvements that will support economic activity in the future A million dollars is a small amount for many things , but there are some activities that work I'm going to list a few examples , but there are certainly others Fund microfinance Basically loan your million dollars to people who need a small amount of money These programs often allow you to determine the initial recipient and then that person determines the next recipient A million dollars can finance hundreds if not thousands of these loans They may be in the United States or in a developing country Set up a scholarship My recommendation would be to find an existing scholarship with a few recipients and ask them to add one a year for the million dollars A million dollars should typically produce about a scholarship a year in returns after inflation Of course , that 's just regular inflation Education inflation is higher Solar prize Fund a program that gives out one solar installation every year or five to a family that owns a house , is struggling to pay utilities , and makes a compelling case Basically , whenever the investment grows enough to support it , make a new prize Buy something that will help other people make money This is just six ideas off the top of my head The goal here is to create something lasting that will promote economic activity So a program that loans money forward Or a scholarship or free textbook , particularly in a STEM field A small piece of infrastructure that helps people move around to work or spend their money Solar is a bit of a stretch here , but it can be justified if you believe that an investment now is an investment in moving towards the future The key thing here is to make your money do double duty By spending your money during a recession or investing during the rest of the business cycle , you can get some value for your money But even better is if that spending has a societal return as well Microfinance , scholarships , and infrastructure do that There is the immediate spending , plus there is the effect of the spending A business is established A mind is trained and working at a high income job People can move , work , and spend their own money

If you do add the extra bits e g follow the XHTML standard , HTML5 will treat them as valid as well However , adding unnecessary bits to your HTML code goes against HTML5 's intention to simplify the language Secondly , previously HTML standards have tried to separate a document 's structure from its presentation , e g using CSS instead of font tags in the HTML document Previously different part of the document is traditionally enclosed by div tags with uniquei IDs for the CSS to render , but a div tag could contain articles , galleries , navigations , etc HTML5 further defines a document 's semantics by adding tags such as nav , section , article , etc This allows for a even more meaningful document , and a computer can understand the document better , e g a screen reader can skip nav sections , or a web spider can provide higher rank when the relevant text is in an article tag

0 I like your question because it is one of those things that , for all practical purposes , is a simple answer but it is a simple answer due to a lot of complicated parts First off , when it comes to trying to understand ownership of intellectual property \( property that you ca n't physically touch \) , it is important to approach it layer by layer Here , for example , we are talking about a song For example , a song can be The potential of a recorded song \( lyrics you 've written down , a music composition you 're developing , etc \) A recorded song that you can listen to , share , etc To help make this all clear , let 's break it down into different scenarios Scenario 1 So let 's say that I am a songwriter I have written a song that involves me singing while playing my acoustic guitar I own the lyrics to my song under copyright and I also own the composition of me playing music accompanying those lyrics This does n't mean someone else ca n't coincidentally come up with the same exact song on their own and own their version it just means that no one is allowed to straight up steal my lyrics and composition from me Scenario 2 Same as Scenario 1 , except now I want to record my song I decide to use my iPhone to record myself playing the song I now own that recording of the song in addition to the components of the song \( lyrics guitar playing \) Scenario 3 Same as Scenario 1 , except now I want to record my song professionally It takes effort and skill to properly record music So I call my friend Bob who has a recording studio in his house , and I go over there and have him record me playing Bob is a friend , so he sends me an MP3 of the recording after we are done But who owns what \? I own the components of the song , but Bob owns that specific recording of me playing This means that if I were to try to sell that MP3 , Bob would have a right to step in and stop me It would be arguable that Bob gave me a license to use that MP3 in certain personal ways \( to play for friends , to upload it on my Facebook , etc \) , but just because Bob recorded me playing my song does not mean I own his recording After all , the recording is a product of his efforts , on his machinery This is why concerts often do not allow fans to record the show and include specific legal small print on the tickets themselves \( or when you buy the tickets \) Because when you record their show , YOU own that recording of the music So if you were to share that recording , it would n't be infringement however , they will come after you under the guise of you agreed not to record , and you did , so you broke our agreement Sidenote Think of copyright as a sticky blob that comes into existence the moment someone creates something through their own efforts Once it happens , un sticking it from a person is complicated The only way to defeat this is to make sure you have contracts in place that intercept the copyright from sticking For example , if you pay me to make you a logo or code a website for you , I own the copyright on your logo or on the code of your website Paying me just gives you a license to use it \( like in Scenario 3 above \) The only way for you to legally own a copyright for something I create is to have a contract before hand that says I am creating a work for hire , which means the copyright wo nt stick to me and , instead , sticks to you Scenario 4 Like Scenario 3 , I want to record my music professionally but ca n't do it myself It used to cost upwards of 250 , 000 to launch an album \( this includes all the costs from start to a finished , plastic wrapped , designed album \) In steps a Recording Label A record label is just like an investor Most people do n't have the money to successfully launch their album Moreover , there are so many artists out there , it is hard for any one artist to get attention Record labels are businesses that try to make a commodity out of music They spot trends or potential start up artists , approach them , and say , Hey , we will cover all of the costs of producing your music in exchange for X ownership of the final product \( the album \) So I work with the record label and the employees of the record label \( all of whom have employment contracts that make their efforts work for hire for the record label \) to produce an album Who owns what \? I still own the components of my music , because I created it before signing onto the record label Without any contracts , the producers and audio engineers would each own a piece of the final recording , but like we already talked about , those things are pre empted by contracts , so the end ownership of the recording of my song is held by the record label This means that if for some reason I decide I want to release my music for free , for example I would be violating the record label 's copyright to release the recording they own That means I would need to re record my song with a different studio , under a different contract that makes the studio 's efforts a work for hire , which gives me an exclusive copyright over the finished work Scenario 5 Expanding on Scenario 4 , let 's say that I am such a big artist that the label is basically paying me a salary They offer me 2 million per year to be contracted as an artist under their label While under contract , I write a new song that is the biggest hit in the history of music Who owns what \? As long as the label did their homework when they wrote the contract \( and you can be sure that they did \) , it will include language that makes me , basically , an employee of the label Which means even though I wrote the song , the label paid me to write it via the salary This means that I own nothing Not the lyrics , not the composition , not the final product TL DR Who owns what depends on the business deals going on behind the scenes Absent any special circumstances , whoever touched it last generally owns the final product , but not necessarily all the components that went into the product But those special circumstances almost certainly exist , especially in this day and age Source I 'm a third year law student with about 10 years experience in intellectual property \( such as copyrights \) and 4 years of experience in the music industry

0 Here 's another attempt at explanation it 's basically because parabolas are flat at the bottom Let me explain As you might know , the variance of the log stock price in Black Scholes is vol 2 T , in other words , variance of the log stock price is linear in time to expiry Now , that means that the standard deviation of your log stock price is square root in time This is consequential For normally distributed random variables , in 68 of cases we end up within one standard deviation So , basically , we expect our log stock price to be within something something times square root of T So , if your stock has a vol of 16 , it 'll be plus minus 32 in 4 years , plus minus 16 for one year , plus minus 8 for 3m , plus minus 4 for 3 ish weeks , and plus minus 1 for a business day As you see , the decay is slow at first , but much more rapid as we get closer How does the square root function look \? It 's a sideways parabola As we come closer to zero , the slope of the square root function goes to infinity \( That is related to the fact that Brownian motion is almost surely no where differentiable it just shoots off with infinite slope , returning immediately , of course \) Another way of looking at it is the old traders rule of thumb that an at the money option is worth approximately S 0 4 vol sqrt \( T \) \( Just do a Taylor expansion of Black Scholes \) Again , you have the square root of time to expiry in there , and as outlined above , as we get closer to zero , the square root drops slowly at first , and then precipitously

0 This is a complicated question that relies on the US India Tax Treaty to determine whether the income is taxable to the US or to India The relevant provision is likely Article 15 on Personal Services http www irs gov pub irs trty india pdf It seems plausible that your business is personal services , but that 's a fact driven question based on your business model If the online training is 'personal services' provided by you from India , then it is likely foreign source income under the treaty The 'fixed base' and '90 days' provisions in Article 15 would not apply to an India resident working solely outside the US The question is whether your US LLC was a US taxpayer If the LLC was a taxpayer , then it has an obligation to pay US tax on any worldwide income and it also arguably disqualifies you from Article 15 \( which applies to individuals and firms of individuals , but not companies \) If you were the sole owner of the US LLC , and you did not make a Form 8832 election to be treated as subject to entity taxation , then the LLC was a disregarded entity If you had other owners , and did not make an election , then you are a partnership and I suspect but cannot conclude that the treaty analysis is still valid So this is fact dependent , but you may be exempt from US tax under the tax treaty However , you may have still had an obligation to file Forms 1099 for your worker You can also late file Forms 1099 reporting the nonemployee compensation paid to your worker Note that this may have tax consequences on the worker if the worker failed to report the income in those years

0 I 'm not entirely positive about this but it 's what I 've always been told The 9 10 of a penny thing started back when a penny had a pretty great value It was an easy way for some gas companies to get more money even back then people only looked at the big numbers and did n't really think about the 9 10 of a cent So if one gas station had their price at 12 a gallon and a different gas station had their price at 129 a gallon , they would get about the same amount of customers , but the second gas station would make more money

0 Computer simulation is the process of mathematical modelling , performed on a computer , which is designed to predict the behaviour of , or the outcome of , a real world or physical system The reliability of some mathematical models can be determined by comparing their results to the real world outcomes they aim to predict Computer simulations have become a useful tool for the mathematical modeling of many natural systems in physics \( computational physics \) , astrophysics , climatology , chemistry , biology and manufacturing , as well as human systems in economics , psychology , social science , health care and engineering Simulation of a system is represented as the running of the system 's model It can be used to explore and gain new insights into new technology and to estimate the performance of systems too complex for analytical solutions Computer simulations are realized by running computer programs that can be either small , running almost instantly on small devices , or large scale programs that run for hours or days on network based groups of computers The scale of events being simulated by computer simulations has far exceeded anything possible \( or perhaps even imaginable \) using traditional paper and pencil mathematical modeling In 1997 , a desert battle simulation of one force invading another involved the modeling of 66 , 239 tanks , trucks and other vehicles on simulated terrain around Kuwait , using multiple supercomputers in the DoD High Performance Computer Modernization Program Other examples include a 1 billion atom model of material deformation a 2 64 million atom model of the complex protein producing organelle of all living organisms , the ribosome , in 2005 a complete simulation of the life cycle of Mycoplasma genitalium in 2012 and the Blue Brain project at EPFL \( Switzerland \) , begun in May 2005 to create the first computer simulation of the entire human brain , right down to the molecular level Because of the computational cost of simulation , computer experiments are used to perform inference such as uncertainty quantification

0 The problem would not only be that of Kyle but also that of American Express When Kyle pays by credit card , American Express pays the bills out of their pockets on his behalf and then forwards the bill to Kyle The issuer of a credit card takes the risk that the holder of the card wo n't pay the credit card bill In practice there are safeguards in place which prevent a company like AE to pay such huge sums in one day through an automated process Credit card companies have sophisticated algorithms to determine unusual spending patterns and block any transactions which appear unusual Also , after a few billions their bank will likely block them and prevent them from paying any more bills But let 's play along and pretend these safeguards would n't exist That means after Kyle 's spending spree , American Express will be trillions in debt , with their main debitor being a 10 year old boy who wo n't ever be able to pay Kyle will have to declare personal bankruptcy There are various variants of bakruptcy in the US , but they basically all boil down to him paying everything he can pay \( not much considering that he is 10 \) and then defaulting on his debt Afterwards he is debt free That means the debt is now that of American Express American Express will not be able to pay that debt with their bank \( s \) either , so they will have to declare bankruptcy and default on their debt too This domino effect passes the burden on to the banks which can not carry a trillion level debt either A bank going bankrupt is a serious issue because it means they can not pay back any of the money in the saving accounts hold by companies or private people with them So the problem would return to those people Kyle wanted to help in the first place Also , the collapse of one bank will often result in the collapse of further banks , resulting in a collapse spiral destroying the whole world wide finance system Nothing would be gained

0 Something that they do n't often mention in science class is that the nature of the universe is a lot weirder than you think it is , in this case the electromagnetic field The EM field is a constant presence throughout the entire universe and light is essentially a wave in that field The speed of light is just the time it takes that wave to move through an EM field This is why light seems to bend when it passes through different transparent things , for instance when you stick a pencil in a glass of water and it looks as if it is bent when you look from the side The atoms in the water change the properties of the EM field , making the light slow down , and through a few involved steps this makes the light bend tl dr The speed of light depends on what you put it in The speed in a vacuum , c , is just the maximum value

0 Here 's a long but complete answer Most computer programs are written by programmers , line by line A human gives the computer super detailed instructions to follow The computer is a dumb machine that follows the instructions The computer can only do what a human was smart enough to tell it exactly how to do But we 've been slowly figuring out ways to creating programs without writing out all the rules by hand Instead , we show computers a bunch of data \( for example , lots of pictures of cats \) and have the computer come up with it 's own rules based on the data \( i e rules to decide if a picture is a cat or not \) This is called Machine Learning It 's allowed us to solve problems that have been nearly impossible to solve in the past with normal hand written programs One way to do machine learning is to create a Neural Network The ideas behind neural networks go back to the 1950s but were fleshed out in the 1970s But neural networks fell out of popularity in the 1980s because they were sloooooow Newer ideas just worked a lot better and a lot faster Anyone still working with neural networks was n't cool anymore and could n't get any money for research But then around 2006 , people started playing around with using 3d video gaming cards \( that same exact GeForce cards you use to play Far Cry 4 or whatever \) to do the math required for neural networks It turns out the kinds of calculations these cards do in a 3d video game \( matrix math \) is exactly what you need for neural networks It was an accident , but this made creating neural networks waaaaaaay faster Because the calculations were way faster and ran in hours instead of months , it became possible to make neural networks much bigger And to everyone 's surprise except maybe Yann LeCun \( URL 0 \) , these bigger neural networks worked a lot better than expected Specifically , they worked better on image recognition when you added lots of layers to the neural network So people came up with a cute name and called this deep learning because the neural networks had lots of layers for the first time This changed everything Problem after problem that seemed nearly impossible to solve in the past now get solved on a regular basis This is what makes things like Siri Google Now possible It 's really the start of a new era in computer science But thanks to this , the word deep now gets thrown around to mean any modern machine learning system Everyone wants to name their company or program Deep something to be cool It 's kind of like how everyone named their company iSomething in 1999 So that 's why you are confused !

0 These are not really different things Almost all languages are procedural Procedural refers to procedures You can think of your code as being one procedure , with maybe sub procedures in it Procedure being one set of instructions that your computer follows Typical example is a recipe , that 's a procedure of sorts Your CPU , at its core , works like this , so most languages derive procedural nature of theirs from CPU However , once you start building these complex procedures \( think of 1 , 000 page long recipes with cross references \) , you 'll notice that it 's actually darn difficult to safely change any section of the recipe and still have any sort of prediction about what is gon na happen next If you change one sub procedure \( sub recipe that may or may not be referenced from elsewhere \) , you 're gon na have to go through all the 1 , 000 pages with care to make sure none of those pages suddenly stop making sense as a result of your one change OOP is a proposed solution to this It packs sub procedures with the data they handle into Objects This means when you make changes into some sub procedure , you only have to check the pages dealing with this object You can , by purposefully programming so that you refrain from referencing to data outside selected pages , do Object Oriented Programming even with programming languages that are purely procedural with no Object Oriented Programming support OOP languages exist to help programming this way , packing data and procedures that handle that data together But the big key thing here is that you will have limited access to all Data , which is managed by objects , so that if data is corrupt , that must be because of the limited number of functions that are allowed to handle that data
0 \( Insert the usual disclaimer that I'm not any sort of tax professional I'm just a random guy on the Internet who occasionally looks through IRS instructions for fun Then again , what you 're doing here is asking random people on the Internet for help , so here goes \) The gigantic book of How to File Your Income Taxes from the IRS is called Publication 17 That 's generally where I start to figure out where to report what The section on Royalties has this to say Royalties from copyrights , patents , and oil , gas , and mineral properties are taxable as ordinary income In most cases , you report royalties in Part I of Schedule E \( Form 1040 \) However , if you hold an operating oil , gas , or mineral interest or are in business as a self employed writer , inventor , artist , etc , report your income and expenses on Schedule C or Schedule C EZ \( Form 1040 \) It sounds like you are receiving royalties from a copyright , and not as a self employed writer That means that you would report the income on Schedule E , Part I I 've not used Schedule E before , but looking at the instructions for it , you enter this as Royalty Property For royalty property , enter code 6 on line 1b and leave lines 1a and 2 blank for that property So , in Line 1b , part A , enter code 6 \( It looks like you 'll only use section A here as you only have one royalty property \) Then in column A , Line 4 , enter the royalties you have received The instructions confirm that this should be the amount that you received listed on the 1099 MISC Report on line 4 royalties from oil , gas , or mineral properties \( not including operating interests \) copyrights and patents Use a separate column \( A , B , or C \) for each royalty property If you received 10 or more in royalties during 2016 , the payer should send you a Form 1099 MISC or similar statement by January 31 , 2017 , showing the amount you received Report this amount on line 4 I do n't think that there 's any relevant Expenses deductions you could take on the subsequent lines \( though like I said , I 've not used this form before \) , but if you had some specific expenses involved in producing this income it might be worth looking into further On Line 21 you 'd subtract the 0 expenses \( or subtract any expenses you do manage to list \) and put the total It looks like there are more totals to accumulate on lines 23 and 24 , which presumably would be equally easy as you only have the one property Put the total again on line 26 , which says to enter it on the main Form 1040 on line 17 and it thus gets included in your income

0 Economically , you would say that purchased and rented real estate are not perfect substitutes they are largely separate markets Only a few people are able to easily switch from one to the other and that choice is sticky for example , once you buy a house , prices would have to rise a lot for it to be worth it to sell it and move into an apartment In both markets there is a supply and demand curve , but the slope of the demand curve for houses to purchase is much steeper than the demand curve for rentals The market for new housing fluctuates rapidly because it requires a large change in housing prices to change the number of people looking to buy a house Most decisions to buy a house are not driven by the state of the housing market This describes a supply demand graph with a very steep demand curve Additionally , because of the leverage provided by mortgages , the demand for houses depends critically on relatively small changes in the interest rate and availability of loans Thus the steep demand curve shifts all over the place as borrowing conditions change On the other hand , apartment prices are more stable because people easily move from one apartment to another and people living in their parent 's basements easily move into apartments if prices change A small change in the price or quantity of rentals brings about reasonable response in quantity demanded This is the situation where the demand curve is shallow In addition , rentals are not tied to interest rates tightly , nor are they as strongly tied to economic conditions \( in a recession , people avoid buying but renters continue to rent \)
0 Not very ELI5 , sorry , maybe someone else can translate this Your taste buds do not die off There is no actual damage associated with spicy foods \( although real inflammation can be induced , it is induced only because of the feeling of heat , not because of actual heat or even chemical damage the inflammation will not be permanent , and will not cause permanent damage , although it can obviously be very painful \) You can have general decrease in the strength of taste signals , but these changes will be temporary , and are NOT a sign of damage , they are just because of general desensitization Capsaicin , the spicy chemical , activates the same nerve receptor that responds to heat , which is why spicy feels hot This receptor is a fairly standard receptor , which means that if you overstimulate it , it will down regulate itself From a quick look at wikipedia , there has n't been a whole lot of research on the mechanism of desensitization for this receptor specifically , but similar systems typically work through negative feedback There are usually lots of receptors at any given location , so if these receptors are constantly stimulated \( eating spicy food very often \) , the receptors will decrease in number They can actually be taken back into the cell , or there may be signals sent to the nucleus of the cell to slow down creation of more receptors Also , there can be downregulation of the signaling pathways that go from receptor activated to neuron signal sent These are more complicated , but they are relatively common mechanisms in the body , especially in neurons This desensitization can be widespread , so that capsaicin can actually cause analgesia \( reduced pain , reduced sensation \) This phenomenon is temporary only TL DR the more you stimulate a group of receptors , the less sensitive that group of receptors becomes

0 Anti Semitism has been present in Europe for centuries , in various forms and with various justifications In the 19th century , now discredited theories on race held that the various races had identifiable , inherent traits , and that races could be organized into a hierarchy \( typically with white , Germanic Europeans or Aryans at the top \) The Volkisch movement saw the world as a battle for world domination between the Aryan and Jewish races Volkisch leaders \( very much pre Nazism \) believed that Jews should be stripped of their rights , property and citizenship , and either expelled from Germany or outright killed Anti Semitism was very much a common feature of life in Germany in this period , in all sectors of society Jews were therefore among the groups that the majority of the population were disposed towards scapegoating One of the most obvious examples of this came after the German surrender in WW1 Germany had been fed constant propaganda during the war about how Germany was on the cusp of victory , right up until its defeat There was a refusal to accept that the German army had been militarily defeated , and the German high command strongly promoted the idea that the army had been betrayed by politicians at home This was a particularly popular view among German soldiers returning from the front , which included Adolf Hitler Liberals and Communists were blamed for Germany 's defeat , both of whom were accused in Anti Semitic writings of being Jewish controlled movements to weaken Germany It 's important to understand the way in which the Nazis , and Hitler in particular , perceived a relationship between Jews and Communism In their mind , Communism was a Jewish plot to control the world \( the number of prominent Jewish Communists certainly helped sell the idea \) , and Jews were therefore trying to spread Communism into Germany from the East An attempted Communist revolution immediately after the end of the war leading to battles on the streets of Berlin and Munich certainly helped cement that idea Hitler himself described his actions as being a fight against Jewish Marxism Of course , the Nazi Party was very skilled at combining left and right wing rhetoric into one In addition to perceiving Communism as a Jewish plot , it also identified capitalism as being a system controlled by the Jews as well The Wall St Crash of 1932 , which propelled the Nazis into power , provided the perfect ammunition for them the capitalists \( Jews \) had destroyed the economy in order to weaken Aryan people and encourage Communist revolution \( also Jews \) In power , the Nazis proceeded to strip Jews of their rights The 1935 Nuremberg Laws stripped them of their citizenship , forbade sex between Jews and non Jews , banned Jews from voting and holding public office In subsequent years , employment and property rights were greatly restricted in an attempt to impoverish Jews Practicing Judaism was , of course , outlawed Pogroms made a comeback , most notably the Kristalnacht of 1938 Quick note the Nazis defined a Jew as someone with three or four Jewish grandparents , regardless of that individual 's religious practices Many Germans who did not previously consider themselves to be Jews suddenly found themselves being persecuted along with those practicing the Jewish faith This was a race based thing to them , not a religious one \( although they did make use of religious rhetoric when it suited \) The initial Nazi plan for the Jews was to resettle them outside of Europe Diplomatic efforts were made to arrange the transport of Jews to French Madagascar , alongside British Rhodesia , Australia , Italian Abyssinia , Siberia and British Palestine \( the Nazis in fact had an agreement with the Zionist Federation of Germany to transport Jews to Palestine right up until the outbreak of the war \) Initially , concentration camps were designed as holding centers until such a transfer too place and not places of extermination \( although death was still common \) After 1939 , things got increasingly worse Camps became a source of slave labour for the war effort , and working people to death became the new norm Those not fit to work were killed immediately The number of deaths was increased in other occupied countries by the creation of death squads , often consisting of local pro Nazi groups such as the Croatian Ustasi , who hunted down and killed partisans and undesirables such as Jews In occupied Poland , ghettos were established to house Jews and other sources of slave labour \( the largest being in Warsaw \) These quickly became unruly sources of resistance , and by 1942 the Nazis \( now no longer advancing in Russia \) began reducing the population of these ghettos The Wannsee Conference in January 1942 brought us into the Final Solution period , which involved transporting all Jews \( and others \) in occupied territories to Poland with the express purpose of extermination This is the period of putting people into cattle trains , and the time of the highest number of killings The worse the war was going for Germany in Russia , the more brutal the killings became The Holocaust of course also affected many other targeted groups , but each of them is a slightly different issue that needs to be explored on its own

0 There are different schools of thought You can ask the IRS and it would not surprise me if you got different answers on different phone calls One interpretation is that a put is not substantially identical to the disposed stock , therefore no wash is triggered by that sale However if that put is exercised , then you automatically purchase the security , and that is identical As to whether the IRS \( or your brokerage firm \) recognizes the identical security when it falls out of an option , I ca n't say but technically they could enforce it because the rule is based on 30 days and a substantially identical stock or security In this interpretation \( your investor \) would probably at least want to stay out of the money in choosing a strike price , to avoid exercise however , options are normally either held or sold , rather than be exercised , until at or very close to the expiration date \( because time value is left on the table otherwise \) So the key driver in this interpretation would be expiration date , which should be at least 31 days out from the stock sale and it would be prudent to sell an out of the money put as well , in order to avoid the wash sale trigger However there is also a more unfavorable opinion see fairmark com capgain wash wsoption htm where they hold that a deep in the money option is an immediate trigger \( regardless of exercise \) This article is sage , in that they say that the Treasury \( IRS \) may interpret an option transaction as a wash if it 's ballpark to being exercisable And , if the IRS throws paper , it always beats each of paper , rock and scissors \( A Schwab article \( A Primer on Wash Sales \) says , if the CUSIPs match , bang , wash This is the one that they may interpret unfavorably on in any case , supporting Schwab 's play it safe position 3 Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities This certainly nails buying a call As to selling a put , well , it is at least conceivable that an IRS official would call that a contract to buy ! SO it 's simply not a slam dunk there are varying opinions that you might describe as ranging from hell no to only if blatant If you can get an official predetermination , or you like to go aggressive in your tax strategy , there 's that they may act adversely , so Caveat Taxfiler !

0 Not going to repeat what others have said , so I will add a new point It also comes down to what is typical considered education When you narrowly define being smart as having attended a university and obtaining a degree in something esoteric , then it 's easy to consider only left leaning people as educated It 's kind of a self fulfilling prophesy Only liberals are smart because only liberals do the things that liberals consider smart When you take into account how many farmers , welders , skilled machinists , small business owners there are that are conservative , and in jobs that actually take a very intelligent person to do well , it kind of forces one to to broaden their definition of educated Once the definition is broadened to not preclude things liberals tend not to choose , the stereotype starts to vanish And then of course you have to also take into account how many conservatives there are in places like business and law And the the conservatives in fields and with degrees in primarily liberal areas who have a justified fear of outing themselves as conservative to their peers The fact is , there are a lot of conservatives out there in just about every area and career you can think of But when you consider that it 's pretty uncool to dangerous these days to openly be conservative in some areas , while at the same time allow only one side to define what smart and educated means \( a definition that suspiciously only fits their side \) , it seems like there are n't any educated conservatives out there

0 I encourage you to think of this home purchase decision as a chance to buy into a community that you want your children to grow up in Try to find a place where you will be happy for the next 20 years , not just the next 2 or 7 years In your situation , option 1 seems like a bad idea It will create an obstacle to having children , instead of establishing a place for them to grow up in Option 2 is close to buying a house on a layaway plan It offers the most financial flexibility It also could result in the best long term outcome , because you will buy in an established area , and you will know exactly what quality house you will have But you and your fianc need to ask yourselves some hard questions Are you willing to put up with the mess and hassles of remodelling \? Are you good at designing such projects \? Can you afford to pay for the projects as they occur \? Or if you need to finance them , can you get a HELOC to cover them \? Especially if you and your fianc do much of the work yourselves , break down the projects into small enough pieces that you can quickly finish off whatever you are working on at the time , and be happy living in the resulting space You do not want to be nagging your husband about an unfinished project forever or silently resenting that a project never got wrapped up I posted some suggestions for incrementally finishing a basement on the Home Improvement Stack Exchange If you are up to the job of option 2 , it is less risky than option 3 Option 3 has several risks You do n't know what sort of people will live in the neighborhood 5 20 years from now Will the homes be owner occupied \?

0 Hebbian theory is a neuroscientific theory claiming that an increase in synaptic efficacy arises from a presynaptic cell 's repeated and persistent stimulation of a postsynaptic cell It is an attempt to explain synaptic plasticity , the adaptation of brain neurons during the learning process It was introduced by Donald Hebb in his 1949 book The Organization of Behavior The theory is also called Hebb 's rule , Hebb 's postulate , and cell assembly theory Hebb states it as follows The theory is often summarized as Cells that fire together wire together However , Hebb emphasized that cell A needs to take part in firing cell B , and such causality can occur only if cell A fires just before , not at the same time as , cell B This aspect of causation in Hebb 's work foreshadowed what is now known about spike timing dependent plasticity , which requires temporal precedence The theory attempts to explain associative or Hebbian learning , in which simultaneous activation of cells leads to pronounced increases in synaptic strength between those cells It also provides a biological basis for errorless learning methods for education and memory rehabilitation In the study of neural networks in cognitive function , it is often regarded as the neuronal basis of unsupervised learning

0 Not all wood rots when it gets wet Bald cypress trees , for example , can grow in a swamp , and their wood can last a long time when submerged Wooden bridges , docks , boats are traditionally built with varieties of cypress , cedar , mahogany , teak and other rot resistant types of lumber Most trees have open cell pores that allow water to wick through the wood Some trees have closed cell pores , and they re more weather resistant If you built one patio chair with white oak , and the other with red oak , the white oak one would last much longer outside Even through they re called Red Oak and White Oak , you ca n t tell them apart by their color If you re at a lumber yard and you want to tell which is which even lumber yards mix them up you look closely at the pores in the end grain In the heartwood of white oak , those pores are plugged up with growths called tyloses If you took a short dowel made from red oak , with its open pores , you could actually force air through it like a straw But not white oak ! That s why wine and whiskey barrels are usually made from white oak Oak is popular for beverage barrels because no wood is totally water proof , and oak imparts a pleasant taste If you have a wine or whiskey barrel , and you let it sit empty , eventually it will dry so much that the wood shrinks and the barrel falls apart There s no glue or screws or nails holding a barrel together , just iron hoops It needs the compression from the swollen wood to stay together To a barrel , dampness is a source of strength , not weakness ! And of course , we have the technology to improve rot resistance in lumber Now that rot resistant trees are few and far between , I m sure they re using pressure treated lumber to renew the wooden foundations in Venice Those buildings need constant maintenance

0 A CPU gets instructions and data from the outside world \( usually through the RAM memory \) telling it what to do It does this by requesting the RAM to send the next instruction data to it , and then reading the result to its internal storage locations As it operates on those , it asks for the next , and the next , and so on As it gets results , it sends data back out in the reverse of the process Those instructions and data are sent to the CPU in chunks The size of the chunk that the CPU can read each time depend on the architecture of the CPU , both how wide its internal storage locations are , and how wide the bus of connections between it and the memory are Way back when CPUs were first invented , that size was as small as 4 bits at a time Over time , that size has been increased to help increase performance , to 8 bits , 16 , 32 , now 64 and even larger Changing the width of the instructions data has two big impacts on performance Since the processor has more bits to work with , it has a larger variety of different instructions that it can execute , and each one can be more powerful Even more importantly , the amount of information that can flow over the connection bus between the CPU and the memory is one of the biggest performance limiters in the system , since the CPU can run much faster internally than that bus can run So making it wider helps reduce this bottleneck It is like making a fire hose fatter so that more water can flow through it per second Another benefit that is gained by the wider bus is that when the CPU asks the memory for instructions data , it must specify a memory address to get them from The larger the number of bits are in this address , the more different locations there can be For example , if the memory address is only 4 bits wide , there are only 2 4 16 different locations \( without doing any tricks \) With a 32 bit bus , there are 2 32 locations , or over 4 billion \( 4 GB \) That number becomes really huge with a 64 bit bus 18 , 446 , 744 , 073 , 709 , 600 , 000 They keep making 32 bit OS 's because some people do n't have 32 bit processors in their computer

0 Long term investors buy into the stock market hoping for an overall long term rise in stock price Day traders , otoh , play the small variations that occur during the normal trading day Whereas investors buy with the intent of holding stock , day traders buy with the intent on flipping that stock as soon as profitable A day trader may sell after a gain of only an 1 8th of a point , or they may hold longer if the stock continues to rise , but they 're most likely unloading it before the end of the day FWIW , I think the mass influx of day traders in the past decade has severely increased the volatility of the market , and taken the what have you done for me lately mentality to new and dizzying heights

0 In computer science , the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm , supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform Thus , the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor Since an algorithm 's running time may vary among different inputs of the same size , one commonly considers the worst case time complexity , which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size Less common , and usually specified explicitly , is the average case complexity , which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size \( this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size \) In both cases , the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the input 226 Since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly , and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential , one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increases that is , the asymptotic behavior of the complexity Therefore , the time complexity is commonly expressed using big O notation , typically O \( n \) displaystyle O \( n \) , O \( n log n \) displaystyle O \( n log n \) , O \( n \) displaystyle O \( n alpha \) , O \( 2 n \) displaystyle O \( 2 n \) , etc , where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the input Algorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big O notation For example , an algorithm with time complexity O \( n \) displaystyle O \( n \) is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity O \( n \) displaystyle O \( n alpha \) for some constant 1 displaystyle alpha 1 is a polynomial time algorithm
0 is it worth it \? You state the average yield on a stock as 2 3 , but seem to have come up with this by looking at the yield of an S P500 index Not every stock in that index is paying a dividend and many of them that are paying have such a low yield that a dividend investor would not even consider them Unless you plan to buy the index itself , you are distorting the possible income by averaging in all these duds You are also assuming your income is directly proportional to the amount of yield you could buy right now But that 's a false measure because you are talking about building up your investment by contributing 2k 3k month No matter what asset you choose to invest in , it 's going to take some time to build up to asset \( s \) producing 20k year income at that rate Investments today will have time in market to grow in multiple ways Given you have some time , immediate yield is not what you should be measuring dividends , or other investments , on in my opinion Income investors usually focus on YOC \( Yield On Cost \) , a measure of income to be received this year based on the purchase price of the asset producing that income If you do go with dividend investing AND your investments grow the dividends themselves on a regular basis , it 's not unheard of for YOC to be north of 6 in 10 years The same can be true of rental property given that rents can rise Achieving that with dividends has alot to do with picking the right companies , but you 've said you are not opposed to working hard to invest correctly , so I assume researching and teaching yourself how to lower the risk of picking the wrong companies is n't something you 'd be opposed to I know more about dividend growth investing than I do property investing , so I can only provide an example of a dividend growth entry strategy Many dividend growth investors have goals of not entering a new position unless the current yield is over 3 , and only then when the company has a long , consistent , track record of growing EPS and dividends at a good rate , a low debt cashflow ratio to reduce risk of dividend cuts , and a good moat to preserve competitiveness of the company relative to its peers \( Amongst many other possible measures \) They then buy only on dips , or downtrends , where the price causes a higher yield and lower than normal P E at the same time that they have faith that they 've valued the company correctly for a 3 year , or longer , hold time There are those who self report that they 've managed to build up a 20k dividend payment portfolio in less than 10 years Check out Dividend Growth Investor 's blog for an example There 's a whole world of Dividend Growth Investing strategies and writings out there and the commenters on his blog will lead to links for many of them I want to point out that income is not just for those who are old Some people planned , and have achieved , the ability to retire young purely because they 've built up an income portfolio that covers their expenses Assuming you want that , the question is whether stock assets that pay dividends is the type of investment process that resonates with you , or if something else fits you better I believe the OP says they 'd prefer long hold times , with few activities once the investment decisions are made , and is n't dissuaded by significant work to identify his investments Both real estate and stocks fit the latter , but the subtypes of dividend growth stocks and hands off property investing \( which I assume means paying for a property manager \) are a better fit for the former In my opinion , the biggest additional factor differentiating these two is liquidity concerns Post tax stock accounts are going to be much easier to turn into emergency cash than a real estate portfolio Whether that 's an important factor depends on personal situation though

0 Important points 1 Single payer is NOT universal You can have single payer and still have people not be included This is rare though 2 Single payer is not uniform It an include different levels of coverage for different people Again , this is rare 3 Single payer is not socialist It can be , but it 's not automatically 4 The single payer operates both ways It 's the single point where money ENTERS the system , and it 's the single point money LEAVES the system OK So lets pretend we have American System and a single payer system , call it DoktorCo In America , you will have 2 4 different health insurance companies where you are Lets say there are 3 of them , and they all have equal amounts of business So if we spend 30 , 000 , they each get 10 , 000 We can call them Aetna , Blue Cross , and Cigna \( A , B and C ! \) When you use medical services , your insurance pays So the doctor sends a bill to A A then has their people review the paperwork , and then sends money to the doctor Now I see the same doctor I 'm with B so he has to do DIFFERENT paperwork , and send it to B , who has different people process it He might also get paid a different amount Now Chuck , who uses C , wants to see the doctor But our doctor does n't accept C ! Chuck has to go see Doc Zed instead That 's annoying That 's the most basic version Compared to DoktorCo Everyone pays DoktorCo So they get all 30 , 000 They only have one set of clerks to handle this \( instead of A B and C having 3 sets \) Every doctor is paid by them They always get the same amount No matter who sees them , they only need to use one set of papers , and only one set of clerks to process it Everything is always the same for every patient It 's a lot simpler The biggest benefit to single payer is efficiency They need less people to do the same work , so less money is wasted You do n't duplicate services You only need one way to make claims , not different ones for every company A very important savings is that they do n't need to compete Aetna , for instance , spends a LOT of money on advertising to convince everyone with Blue Cross to pick Aetna instead That 's money you pay them for health care that is NOT being spent on health care Single payer does not need to do this Also , because it 's being run as a non profit , your health care dollars are not actually going to corporate profit margins

0 Generally , a share of stock entitles the owner to all future per share dividends paid by the company , plus a fraction of the company 's assets net value in the event of liquidation If one knew in advance the time and value of all such payouts , the value of the stock should equal the present cash value of that payout stream , which would in turn be the sum of the cash values of all the individual payouts As time goes by , the present cash value of each upcoming payout will increase until such time as it is actually paid , whereupon it will cease to contribute to the stock 's value Because people are not clairvoyant , they generally do n't know exactly what future payouts a stock is going to make A sane price for a stock , however , may be assigned by estimating the present cash value of its future payments If unfolding events would cause a reasonable person to revise estimates of future payments upward , the price of the stock should increase If events cause estimates to be revised downward , the price should fall In a sane marketplace , if the price of a stock is below people 's estimates of its payouts' current cash value , people should buy the stock and push the price upward If it is above people 's estimates , they should sell the stock and push the price downward Note that in a sane marketplace , rising prices are a red flag indicator for people to stop buying Unfortunately , sometimes bulls see a red flag as a signal to charge ahead When that happens , prices may soar through the roof , but it 's important to note that the value of the stock will still be the present cash value of its future payouts If that value is 10 share , someone who buys a share for 50 basically gives the seller 40 that he was not entitled to , and which the buyer will never get back The buyer might manage to convince someone else to pay him 60 for the share , but that simply means the new buyer is giving the the previous one 50 that he was n't entitled to either If the price falls back to 10 , calling that fall a market correction would n't be a euphemism , but rather state a fact the share was worth 10 before people sold it for crazy prices , and still worth 10 afterward It was the market price that was in error The important thing to focus on as a sane investor is what the stock is actually going to pay out in relation to what you put in It 's not necessary to look only at present price earnings ratios , since some stocks may pay little or nothing today but pay handsomely next year What 's important , however , is that there be a reasonable likelihood that in the foreseeable future the stock will pay dividends sufficient to justify its cost

0 A lot of people in this thread are saying that if other animals had such a large and lengthy society as humans they would be like us I disagree with this belief The simple fact is that a large brain has a huge caloric demand that most species do n't prioritize over other bodily needs So basically as a human you eat a ton of calories to support muscle growth or repairing your body and then on top of that you eat a bunch more calories and fatty foods to support your brain The reason humans developed so energy hungry brains is up for debate , but why we can support them is more obvious There are three main reasons that allow us to support brains so much larger than other species that are similar sized For one we are omnivores \( we eat both plants and animals \) so in any environment finding something to sustain ourselves is n't incredibly difficult We are also very fast predators Of all the large predators \( think 100 pounds \) humans have one of the most specialized endocrine system Our endocrine system governs our sweating and heat management so even though our top speed \( about 25 mph \) is n't very fast we can maintain a relatively quick jog longer than other large mammals So our miles per hour movement is less than other animals , but our migration per week is much faster than anything our size Being able to move to the most food rich areas before other species is a huge advantage Lastly we figured out how to cook food Cooked food is incredibly calorie dense while also being easier to chew and digest There is actually a very strong connection between how long an animal eats and how large their brain is \( URL 0 \) So being able to eat a lot of calories quickly allows us to maintain are larger more complex brains So society is the reason we are so advanced , but society is only possible because our large brains allow us to learn and pass down information in ways that other animals simply ca n't do We have tried raising other apes as if they were humans to see if it really is just environment that is the difference They actually can learn some basic things like language and actually advance quicker than humans to start , but at a young age their brains stop developing and humans just keep growing

0 As an animator I think I can clear some things up You ask how can it be so expensive \? Computer graphics first and foremost are an art form Art takes years to get good at , the skill required is extremely high , not only technical skill , but also artistic skill Skill costs money The programs involved for creating animation are very expensive Maya , a single license may cost 5 , 000 for a single seat Maya is just one program , you may need to buy RenderMan for rendering You probably are going to buy the entire Adobe Suite , 3DS Max depending on the studio You may need Houdini for FX , there are many programs these are just a few This part really requires you to have done the work to really appreciate how much really goes into that scene you are seeing in a movie , but I will try to break it down No one really does everything for a scene anymore , there really are n't any generalists You have people that are skilled at one thing and do that over and over For example , you have an entire department that makes concept art , they take this concept art and pitch a movie They then use this concept art for the modeling department Now there are probably going to be two kinds of modelers There are going to be scene modelers and character modelers This character model gets passed to the rigger , now a rigger , think of him as a technical artist Think about your bones in your body , how your skeleton is created , think of a rigger as creating a skeleton for a model to control the character Now the rig is passed to the animator , the animator brings the character to life Animation is very hard , you have to think of yourself as an actor , in some ways a mechanic , thinking of forces of weight of physicality of motion Probably around this same time , they are working on the scene , they are modeling the scene There is an entire department that just does camera work and lighting Mind you there are positions at places like Dreamworks , they call them a technical artist Basically what this person does is create programs within a program So they are creating programs within maya After all of this is done is passed off to post production Rendering , mind you for some scenes it may take 8 hours to render a single frame This requires an enormous amount of computing power , which again is expensive They are also doing post production , color correction , compositing , many different aspects , using tools like Nuke They also may add in FX , particle FX , fluid dynamics Now you are talking about hundreds of positions for a single film Now let 's do some math here Let 's say it took 300 people to create a film in oh , 3 years , for simplicity sake , we 'll say they got paid 120 , 000 \( Starting pay for certain positions is 75 , 000 \) 120 , 000 x 3 years x 300 people 108 , 000 , 000 Now of course it is not as simple as that , but that is just an illustration of how expensive things get very quickly

0 This is a tough question to give a definitive answer to since customs vary in every tea drinking country , and every person has their own tastes and preferences That being said , generally darker and stronger black teas are drank with milk and or sugar since they tend to have more tannins \( a result of the fermentation process \) that give them a more bitter taste , which is balanced out by the milk Some black teas such as Earl Grey or Darjeeling are a bit lighter and less bitter , and as such are usually drank with lemon or honey sans milk A rule of thumb is that green , white and oolong teas should n't be served with milk , but rather unsweetened or with a dash of honey sugar to taste This is because these teas are either non fermented or lightly fermented , leading to a more delicate flavor that does n't require milk to balance things out I 've personally tried milk in green and white teas several times over the years , and it usually winds up tasting like a cup of vaguely tea flavored milk as opposed to a cup of richly flavored tea There 's some health talk floating around the internet that putting milk into a cup of tea also diminishes the antioxidants and healthy qualities of the brew somehow , but I would n't put too much stake in that personally

If you 're set on pursuing the car loan , just go talk to some lenders You 'll want to shop around for a good rate anyway , so no need to speculate just go find out Include the dealership as a potential financing option , they can have great rates Personally , I 'd get a much cheaper car Your insurance premium on a 100k car will be quite high due to your age You might be rightly confident in your earning potential , but nothing is guaranteed , situations can change wildly in short order A new car is not a good investment or a value retaining asset , so why bother going into debt for one if you do n't have to \? If you buy something in cash now , you could upgrade in a few years without financing if your earning prediction holds and would save quite a bit in car insurance and interest over the years between
0 There are many ways to calculate the return , and every way will give you a different results in terms of a percentage value One way to always get something meaningful count the cash You had 977 \( 31 \) and in the end you have 1 370 , which means you have earned 363 dollars But what is your return in terms of percentage \? One way to look at it , is by pretending that it is a fund in which you invest 1 dollar What is the fund worth in the beginning and in the end \? The tricky part in your example is , you injected new capital into the equation Initially you invested 977 dollars which later , in the second period became worth 1 473 You then sold off 200 shares for 950 dollars Remember your portfolio is still worth 1 473 , split between 950 in cash and 523 in Shares So far so good still easy to calculate return \( 1 473 977 1 50 8 return \) Now you buy share for 981 dollars , but you only had 950 in cash \? We now need to consider 2 scenarios Either you \( or someone else \) injected 31 dollars into the fund or you actually had the 31 dollars in the fund to begin with If you already had the cash in the fund to begin with , your initial investment is 1 008 and not 977 \( 977 in shares and 31 in cash \) In the end the value of the fund is 1 370 , which means your return is 1 370 1 007 36 Consider if the 31 dollars was paid in to the fund by someone other than you You will then need to recalculate how much you each own of the fund Just before the injection , the fund was worth 950 in cash and 387 in stock \( 310 200 110 x 3 54 \) 1 339 dollars then 31 dollars are injected , bringing the value of the fund up to 1 370 The ownership of the fund is split with 1 339 1 370 97 8 of the value for the old capital and 2 2 for the new capital If the value of the fund was to change from here , you could calculate the return for each investor individually by applying their share of the funds value respective to their investment Because the value of the fund has not changed since the last period \( bullet 3 \) , the return on the original investment is \( 977 1 339 1 37 2 \) and the return on the new capital is \( 31 31 0 \) If you \( and not someone else \) injected the 31 dollar into the fund , you will need to calculate the weight of each share of capital in each period and get the average return for each period to get to a total return In this specific case you will still get 37 2 return but it gets even more comlex for each time you inject new capital
0 The US tends to use technology to produce more gasoline than diesel from a unit of oil Recently , likely thanks to higher efficiency , there 's been an increase in demand for diesel \( not least because diesel contains more energy than gasoline per unit of volume which is how both are priced so even at a higher price per gallon it 's more economical for many potentially tradable uses \) The increase in demand for diesel , has n't been sustained long enough for refiners to alter their mix of gasoline and diesel

0 It depends primarily on how the Canadian economy is designed i e export oriented or import oriented If you look at this , it shows more or less equal amount of exports and imports For the specific case of Canada , the exports would become costlier , because of a costlier dollar , but at the same time imports would become cheaper This is only a generalization , not specific goodswise , which would require a more detailed ananlysis But investors have a different dilemma Canadian investors would find it cheaper to invest abroad so may channel their investments abroad because they may find it costlier to invest in Canada While foreign investors would find it costlier to invest in Canada and may wait for later or invest somehwre else Then government may try to boost up investment and start lowering the interest rates , if it sees the rising dollar as detrimental for the Canadian economy and investments flowing abroad instead of Canada But what would be the final outcome of the whole rigmarole is little difficult to predict , because something is arriving and something is departing and above all goverment is doing something or is going to do But the basic gist is Canadian exporters will be sad and Canadian importers will be happy , but vice versa for foreign investors intending to invest in Canada

0 hi , thank you for providing the brief history of you as you mentioned you took are using vagifem and want to know if DVT is caused because of it well , what drugs can react is not a known cause as most drugs undergo a complete research process but human body is different in many ways from one to another the only way to find that if this drug is giving trouble is by stopping it for DVT one needs to understand that there is a clot which is blocking the venous drainage system which can be symptomatically treated by medical unit , but the body needs an internal way of clearing this out by improving the metabolism and also the immune system for DVT there are exercises which also becomes useful along with medicine and provides a good support system to the human body to heal For DVT exercises related questions you can ask me directly regardsJay Indravadan Patel

0 Actually , modern day China is far more capitalistic than the USA is That is why there is an increasing gap between rich and poor in China During the rule of Mao Zedong \( 1949 1976 \) , China had the classic Stalinist socialist economic structure Security for the people was known as the iron rice bowl This included the right and duty of employment , housing and medical care Private enterprise was for the most part not tolerated , but in times of crisis it was tolerated like after the Great Famine of 1959 The Maoist Cultural Revolution put a stop to any private enterprise from 1966 to 1976 The shift to the free market economy began in China after the 1978 reforms Bit by bit the iron rice bowl security net was dismantled

0 There 's not a single answer here , as the premium you pay for car insurance depends on multiple factors , including \( but not limited to \) All these factors contribute to the likelihood of getting into an accident , and the expected damage from an accident So just having an accident and making a claim will likely raise your premium \( all else being equal \) , but whether or not it will be cheaper in the long run depends \( obviously \) on how much your premium goes up , which cannot determined without all of the facts Your agent could tell you how much it would go up , but even making such an inquiry would likely be noted on your insurance record , and may cause your premium to go up \( although probably not by as much \) However , the point of insurance is to reduce the out of pocket expenses from future accidents , so the question to ask is How likely am I to have another accident , and if I do , can I pay cash for it or will I need to offset some cost with an insurance claim Do you risk making a claim and having your rates go up by more than 700 over the next 3 4 years \( the rough time it takes for a surcharge to expire \) \?

0 Hedging isolates and protects your investment or deal from something that you do n't control Imagine that are a farmer and what you are good at is producing wheat You ca n't control the price of wheat , but you can control your quality To hedge against the price of wheat changing , you can do several things For example , you can buy sell a futures contract That is to say , if your crop will be ready in 6 months , you can sign a contract to sell your wheat at a specific price determined today in 6 months If the price goes higher than expected , you do n't benefit , but if the price goes lower , you do n't lose This contract is in theory free to sign , but can force a future gain or loss which would perfectly counterbalance the gain or loss in the value of your wheat There are variations on this \( mainly future contracts and forward contracts \) and I would be happy to explain the difference if you like You can also buy an option For example , you can buy a put option to sell your wheat at 2 per kilo in six months If the price is 3 , you wo n't use your option \( it will expire worthless \) , but if the price is 1 , you will exercise your option and force the person who sold it to you to buy your wheat at 2 This guarantees you a minimum sale price , but costs money today to purchase Again , there are variations of this \( mainly various types of put options and call options \) and I would be happy to explain the difference A farmer could also hedge against the possibility of a snow storm , crop failure , or any other risk to his business Similarly , a mining company might be very good at getting gold out of the ground , but might not want to bet its future on how much gold is worth in two years , so they hedge against the changes in price in gold A construction company might be good at building houses , but not want to bet its future on changes in the housing market , so it can hedge against changes in housing prices It 's worth noting that each hedge takes two parties to the trade If I buy an option , somebody has to sell it to me In theory , we can both be hedging , but in practise , there is never a perfect balance of people looking to hedge In order for hedging to work , therefore , there has to be speculators That is to say , when a gold company hedges against gold , they are effectively insuring themselves in case it goes down The person on the other side of the trade is usually a speculator who thinks that it wo n't go down A last interesting note is that hedge funds are precisely the opposite of what their name implies They use hedging instruments to make speculative bets They actively seek more risk to multiply their potential gains on the way that they think the market will go

0 Not exactly ELI5 but I 'll do my best to take a stab at it with some pseudo code I 'm coming from a Laravel PHP angle Model Items Controller ItemController View Shops The view Shops is merely a template for lack of better term Basically we have a page where we are going to spit out the data for a record in our imaginary inventory The page will have a title , and an array data We will get our data from the DB with a model called Items Think of this as a class that handles all interaction with the DB and abstracts the SQL implementation away Our Controller titled ItemController will handle all business logic If title Acme Co title title title title Acme Co title Now we need to bring the item into the view , right \? For simplicity we 'll just have two things in our array data data 'price ' and data 'item name ' price shall be 20 00 and item name shall be RC Car Fancy So our view is a very simple html page with a title and a table title title title table tr td Product Name td td data 'item name ' td tr tr td Price d td data 'price ' td tr Now we have the same thing but parsed table tr td Product Name td td RC Car td tr tr td Price d td 20 00 td tr Now imagine if data had several more indexes We have one view that we pass this data to But how do we get the data \? The model , right \? Well , yes and no So a brief bit tying business logic to your view \( the pretty \) makes for a mess It 's like putting everything into a blender for a beverage and then not putting the lid on When it 's done you then swing it around to really get everything everywhere Now then The controller handles this pairing We have things called routes , so we 're going to tell the application \( website \) to point to the ItemController when the page is requested For instance , Route get \( 'item id ' , ' InventoryController show \) So what does that do \? Simple , really In our InventoryController class we have a method called show All we 're doing is saying when item is requested go here if there is a parameter \( i d \) So say our RC car above had an i d of 0 We 'd go to URL 0 and the example above would be rendered Controller time ! InventoryController extends Controller public function show \( id \) Item is in our auto load This class is accessible app wide data Item where \( 'id ' , ' ' , i d \) title Viewing Details for data 'item name ' View is in the same boat Auto loaded return View make \( 'itempage view php ' , title \) with \( data , data \) All of that returns the view above , just like before Now though , we 're going to spice it up ! We have another product i d 1 item name RC Boat price 25 00 When we call to URL 1 guess what ! Our application automagically fills in the information for the item matching the i d of 1 Fancy ! Back to the ELI5 attempt Automatic coloring books and stencils MVC \( kind of \) Code Reuse \( stencils \) is considered , for good reason , to be a sign of a capable developer We get to reuse the same files passing in only a parameter to change the outcome When we first called the page we had an i d of 0 The RC Car was returned Then we simply changed the URL to have a 1 which returned the RC Boat Same files different page In a real world example we 'd probably have a master page \( coloring book \) that served as the main template for all pages This would have our CSS , JS , and other elements all centrally located MVC means you no longer have to update your pages individually to change something like your navigation or header It 's all in one spot It means no need for nasty database interaction spattered all over your php files All of that is handled in your database object That is a central concept Centralized code management and maintenance I do n't think I quite hit the ELI5 nail on the head , but I hope this helps anyone that might be confused I know it took me a bit to figure out this MVC thing

0 When buying investment properties there are different levels of passive investment involved At one end you have those that will buy an investment property and give it to a real estate agent to manage and do n't want to think of it again \( apart from watching the rent come in every week \) At the other end there are those that will do everything themselves including knocking on the door to collect the rent Where is the best place to be well somewhere in the middle The most successful property investors treat their investment properties like a business They handle the overall management of the properties and then have a team taking care of the day to day nitty gritty of the properties Regarding the brand new or 5 to 10 year old property , you are going to pay a premium for the brand new A property that is 5 years old will be like new but without the premium I once bought a unit which was 2 to 3 years old for less than the original buyer bought it at brand new Also you will still get the majority of the depreciation benefits on a 5 year old property You also should not expect too much maintenance on a 5 to 10 year old property Another option you may want to look at is Defence Housing They are managed by the Department of Defence and you can be guaranteed rent for 10 years or more , whether they have a tenant in the property or not They also carry out all the maintenance on the property and restore it to original condition once their contract is over The pitfall is that you will pay a lot more for the management of these properties \( up to 15 or more \) Personally , I would not go for a Defence Housing property as I consider the fees too high and would not agree with some of their terms and conditions However , considering your emphasis on a passive investment , this may be an option for you

0 Humans normally have 3 kinds of color photoreceptors \( aka cones \) S , M , and L , for Short wavelength , M for medium wavelength and L , Long wavelength This sort of but not really corresponds to blue , green and red Your genes \( thanks mom ! \) code for a defective protein that effectively knocks out one of your 3 categories of color receptors The human brain is designed to interpret the relative strengths of the three channels as different colors Those with the normal complement of 3 kinds of cones can recognize approximately 11 million colors Those with only two functional types of cones can only see approximately 10 20 of that \( I 'm going by \( old \) memory on the numbers \) The most common is red green colorblindness There are other more exotic kinds of color blindness Some people have two defective sets of cones Some have no functional cones at all True complete color blindness is extremely rare In the US , 8 or 9 of males are colorblind A small fraction of 1 of females are affected It is thought that there are a few very specific examples where colorblind people can distinguish some shades that normally sighted people can not There are also some camouflage that they can easily see that are very difficult for normally sighted folk Hey , you have a minor superpower The military experimented with a special red contact that you wear on one eye only that allows you to perceive different shades that you are incapable of discriminating between now It was called the x chrome lens It wo n't really give you true color vision , and the ability to now pass the Ishahara color test is really just an interesting artifact Your brain is fine , but one of your three color channels never sends anything You ca n't fly an airplane , at least not commercially You ca n't be a licensed electrician You should n't be on the bomb squad , since sometimes distinguishing the red wire and the green wire really really matter You should n't be an interior decorator , since you ca n't distinguish different shades of color very well or at all in some wavelengths URL 0 I 'm an optometrist hth
0 Yahoo 's Adj Close data is adjusted for splits , but not for dividends Despite Yahoo 's webpage 's footnote saying Close price adjusted for dividends and splits we can see empirically that the Adj Close is only adjusted for splits For example , consider Siemens from Jan 27 , 2017 to Mar 15 , 2017 The Adj Close adjusts for splits On any particular day , the Adj Close is equal to the Close price divided by the cumulative product of all splits that occurred after that day If there have been no splits after that day , then the Adj Close equals the Close price Since there is a 2 for 1 split on Mar 14 , 2017 , the Adj Close is half the Close price for all dates from Jan 27 , 2017 to Mar 13 , 2017 Note that if Siemens were to split again at some time in the future , the Adj Close prices will be readjusted for this future split For example , if Siemens were to split 3 for 1 tomorrow , then all the Adj Close prices seen above will be divided by 3 The Adj Close is thus showing the price that a share would have traded on that day if the shares had already been split in accordance with all splits up to today The Adj Close does not adjust for dividends Notice that Siemens distributed a 1 87 dividend on Feb 02 , 2017 and 3 74 dividend on Jan 30 , 2017 If the Adj Close value were adjusted for these dividends then we should expect the Adj Close should no longer be exactly half of the Close amount But we can see that there is no such adjustment the Adj Close remains \( up to rounding \) exactly half the Close amount Note that in theory , the market reacts to the distribution of dividends by reducing the trading price of shares post dividend This in turn is reflected in the raw closing price So in that sense the Adj Close is also automatically adjusted for dividends But there is no formula for this The effect is already baked in through the market 's closing prices

0 Humans originated in the hot savannah of Africa The leading theory on how people back then hunted was running down animals for many miles This was reliant on tiring the animal out from constantly running to where the human could get close and kill it Because of the heat generated by running in the 100 degree savanah , humans evolved to dump heat as efficiently as possible This meant that we lost a lot of fur \( except for some around the head and other places to shield from UV exposure \) Here 's a video of modern African tribesman hunting using the techniques described above \( URL 0 \) Fast forward couple hundred thousand years and people moved north By this time people were intelligent and instead of waiting for evolution to take place which would have happened over thousands of years The people realized they can take the fur of other animals and use it for themselves This caused body heat preserving fur to no longer be an evolutionary variable In essence , someone who was furrier than another would n't necessarily be more suited to survive and pass on their genes than someone who was hairless because both a furry person and a non furry person would both survive because of fur coats

0 Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered positive and those for which it is not are considered negative If the true condition can not be known , a gold standard test is assumed to be correct In a diagnostic test , sensitivity is a measure of how well a test can identify true positives and specificity is a measure of how well a test can identify true negatives For all testing , both diagnostic and screening , there is usually a trade off between sensitivity and specificity , such that higher sensitivities will mean lower specificities and vice versa If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as having the condition , the number of true positives should be high and the number of false negatives should be very low , which results in high sensitivity This is especially important when the consequence of failing to treat the condition is serious and or the treatment is very effective and has minimal side effects If the goal is to return the ratio at which the test identifies the percentage of people highly likely to be identified as not having the condition , the number of true negatives should be high and the number of false positives should be very low , which results in high specificity That is , people highly likely to be excluded by the test This is especially important when people who are identified as having a condition may be subjected to more testing , expense , stigma , anxiety , etc The terms sensitivity and specificity were introduced by American biostatistician Jacob Yerushalmy in 1947
0 Because property ownership pretty much anywhere in the world , and certainly in the U S , is essentially by Feudal Title meaning you pay in perpetuity for the right to retain title The opposite would be Allodial Title which implies never being beholden to any superior power Feudal in this sense is n't as bad as it sounds If the government had no vested interest in your property then its laws would not apply anywhere on your property It would be none of the government 's business if you were robbed or murdered on your own sovereign land Feudal title , in a reasonably democratic state , provides all sorts of perks that you would normally have to pay for anyway Police , fire and emergency services , the maintenance of easements between properties \( roads \) , connection to public utilities like sewer and water , etc It 's kind of like an involuntary condo arrangement or homeowner 's association which makes holding title to land much more affordable for the average person

0 First generation incestuous children do n't typically have defects , even between full siblings It often takes multiple generations of incest , or just bad luck of the draw , to have children with birth defects The reason this happens is , in an oversimplified explanation , that you get two copies of genes \( one from each parent \) if you get a ' broken ' one this generally does n't effect you because you have a working one that takes over If you have two defective ones , you present with a defect
0 For sexual reproduction to occur , you need the sperm and the egg from the parents \( the two are collectively referred to as gametes \) Gametes are produced in a process called meiosis , and the chromosomes of the animal have to pair up to another similar chromosome for this process to happen Usually within one species , healthy individuals have similar chromosomes , but also the same number of chromosomes The offspring inherits the same number of chromosomes from the father as from the mother So the chromosomes can pair up easily to allow meiosis to take place But different species have different chromosomes and also different numbers of chromosomes For example , a horse has 32 chromosome pairs , whilst a donkey has 31 chromosome pairs So when the two interbreed to give birth to a mule , the mule will inherit 31 chromosomes from the donkey parent and 32 from the horse parent To top this off , the chromosomes are very different This means that the chromosomes fail to pair up so gametes can not be made by the mule

0 The breakeven amount is n't at 8 years You calculated how many years of paying 500 it would take to break even with one year of paying 4000 8 x 10 years 80 years So by paying 500 year it will take you 80 years to have spent the same amount \( 40000 total \) as you did in 10 years At this point it may seem obvious what the better choice is Consider where you 'll be after 10 years In scenario 1 you 've spent 5000 \( 500 10 \) and have to continue spending 500 year indefinitely In scenario 2 you 've spent 40000 \( 4000 10 \) and do n't have to pay any more , but you currently have 35000 \( 40000 5000 \) less than you did in scenario 1 If you had stayed with scenario 1 you could invest that 35000 at a measly 1 43 annual return and cover the 500 payments indefinitely without ever dipping into your remaining 35000 Most likely over the long term you 'll do better than 1 43 per year and come out far ahead

0 A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words Given any sequence of words of length m , a language model assigns a probability P \( w 1 , , w m \) displaystyle P \( w 1 , ldots , w m \) to the whole sequence Language models generate probabilities by training on text corpora in one or many languages Given that languages can be used to express an infinite variety of valid sentences \( the property of digital infinity \) , language modeling faces the problem of assigning non zero probabilities to linguistically valid sequences that may never be encountered in the training data Several modelling approaches have been designed to surmount this problem , such as applying the Markov assumption or using neural architectures such as recurrent neural networks or transformers Language models are useful for a variety of problems in computational linguistics from initial applications in speech recognition to ensure nonsensical \( i e low probability \) word sequences are not predicted , to wider use in machine translation \( e g scoring candidate translations \) , natural language generation \( generating more human like text \) , part of speech tagging , parsing , Optical Character Recognition , handwriting recognition , grammar induction , information retrieval , and other applications Language models are used in information retrieval in the query likelihood model There , a separate language model is associated with each document in a collection Documents are ranked based on the probability of the query Q in the document 's language model M d displaystyle M d P \( Q M d \) displaystyle P \( Q mid M d \) Commonly , the unigram language model is used for this purpose

0 Basically what littleadv said , but let me amplify what I think is the most important point As he she says , one thing you 're paying them for is their expertise If the title on record at the county office had a legal flaw in it , would you recognize it \? In a way your question is like asking , Why should I go to a doctor when I could just make my own medicine out of herbs I grow in my garden and treat myself \? Maybe you could But the doctor and the pharmacist have years of training on how to do this right You probably do n't Is it possible for you to learn everything you need to do it right \? Sure But do you want to spend the time to study all that for something that you will do buy a house maybe once every ten years \? Will you remember it all next time or have to learn it all over \? But really most important is , title companies offer insurance in case the title turns out to be flawed That , to me , is the big reason why I would use a title company even if I was paying cash and there was no bank involved to insist on it If there 's some legal flaw in the title and it turns out that someone else has a claim to my house , and I lose in court , I would be out about 100 , 000 Your house might be costing you much more That 's a huge risk to take Paying the couple of hundred dollars for insurance against that risk seems well worth it to me And by the way , I do n't think the due diligence is easy It 's NOT just a matter of making sure a title is really on file at the court house and has the proper stamp on it It 's all about , Does someone else have a legal claim to this property \? Like , maybe three owners ago someone forged a signature on a deed , so the sale is fraudulent , and now the person who was defrauded or his heirs discover the issue and claim the property Or maybe the previous owner failed to pay a contractor who did repairs on the house , and now he goes to court and gets a lien on the property It 's unlikely that you have the expertise to recognize a forged document You almost surely have no way to recognize a forged signature of someone you never met on an otherwise valid looking document And you 'd have to do a lot of research to find every contractor who ever worked on the house and insure none of them have a claim Etc

0 Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high level understanding from digital images or videos From the perspective of engineering , it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring , processing , analyzing and understanding digital images , and extraction of high dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information , e g in the forms of decisions Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images \( the input of the retina \) into descriptions of the world that make sense to thought processes and can elicit appropriate action This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry , physics , statistics , and learning theory The scientific discipline of computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images The image data can take many forms , such as video sequences , views from multiple cameras , multi dimensional data from a 3D scanner , or medical scanning devices The technological discipline of computer vision seeks to apply its theories and models to the construction of computer vision systems Sub domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction , object detection , event detection , video tracking , object recognition , 3D pose estimation , learning , indexing , motion estimation , visual servoing , 3D scene modeling , and image restoration

Mostly No Let me explain While wma does n't produce cd quality at low bitrates , it does better than mp3 when below 128 At 128 or above there is no reason not to use mp3 as mp3 can be made superior As storage space is now cheap and available , we no longer care about lower quality music to save space 128 or above use mp3 , below use wma But for music you should not be under 192 anyways , so wma is worthless There is a WMA lossless format as well , but it is inferior to other alternatives as well If you 're wondering , many tests have show the optimal music rate is 192 VBR mp3 encoded with LAME \( aka alt preset standard \) Anything more is almost always indistinguishable , less is sub par quality As for format usability , everything plays mp3 , most stuff also plays wma , but why the hell do you even take a chance with wma when you can just make a better mp3 file \?

0 Suppose there 's two persons Mary Baker and John Farmer Mary 's a baker , John 's a wheat farmer Therefore , Mary often buys wheat , John often sells it Now , John has two problems 1 How does he plan how much wheat to grow during the season \? If he grows too much , he will have spent too much money on seed , fertilizer , etc If he grows too little , he will not have earned as much money as he could have 2 Suppose he makes his plan , grows the wheat , but then at when it 's ready , the price of wheat has dropped a lot In this case , he may lose money or at least not make the profit he expected Mary also has a problem She makes most of her money from wedding cakes Everybody gets married in the same season , but they want to know the price of the cake six months before the wedding But Mary does n't know how much wheat will cost when she makes the cakes so if she gives a quote with current wheat prices , and the price goes up , she may end up losing money There 's a way to solve all of these problems in one shot John and Mary come to an agreement where Mary will buy John 's wheat 6 months from now , but at today 's wheat price This way , John knows how much wheat to grow and how much he will be paid for it , and Mary knows how much she will pay for her wheat as well Well , futures trading is basically what you get when you recognize that this idea can be improved by making it work like sports betting We have a bookie \( the futures exchange \) that takes bets on the price of wheat always taking a bit off the top as payment Mary figures out how much wheat she will need , and then she goes to the bookie and offers a bet that wheat prices will go up The size of the bet is based on how much wheat she will need , and she wins or loses money proportionate to how far the price ends up from today 's price So now , if wheat goes up she loses on the cakes but makes up for it by the earnings of the bet \( If wheat goes down , she loses on her bet but spends less on the wheat for the cakes \) John goes to the bookie as well , sees Mary 's offered bet , and accepts the other side of it he bets that wheat prices will go down He uses the amount of Mary 's \( and other people 's \) bets to plan how much wheat to grow That way he does n't grow too much wheat , and if wheat prices actually go down , he makes less on his wheat but wins it back from the bet So that achieves the same thing as the first solution , but Mary and John did n't even need to know about each other they just deal with a common third party \( the bookie futures exchange \)

Some other posters are right The antibiotic goes wherever the body sends it The antibiotic is designed to be more toxic to the bacteria because it is designed to attack parts of the bacteria that ideally our cells do not have Bacterial cells have some important parts that our cells do not The things called enzymes that make these parts are what the antibiotics normally work against We also can design drugs that behave differently in our bodies to make them more useful By making changes to the chemical structures we can make them absorb better in our stomachs so they get in our bodies faster , or make them slower to leave our blood If you have a urinary tract infection , a drug that gets in your urine fast is great If you have a bad case of food poisoning , a drug that stays in the gut rather than being absorbed in your stomach is a better option So knowing where you are sick and what is causing your illness all are factors in deciding which antibiotics to prescribe

0 Hi ! Chemist here who works for the County Sanitation District of Los Angeles County We are a government agency but we are not funded by the government Our funding comes from fees for using the sewer system We also operate landfills that also provide methane for our power plants ! Here 's a little background on our sanitation system We are 17 sanitation districts serving 73 cities and various unincorporated areas around Los Angeles County Collectively the entire connected sewage system is called the Joint Outfall System and processes about 165 million gallons daily For more information visit this page URL 3 First Step Raw The raw influent comes in directly from the sewer system We send this raw influent over to our primary sedimentation tanks This is an overview of the entire process URL 1 Second Step Primary The primary effluent is allowed to settle in giant concrete tanks This allows most organic materials to sink and plastic or inorganic materials to float \( mostly \) This process is only physical and removes approximately 60 70 of the solids normally found in the raw influent The plastic and inorganic materials are skimmed off and sent down the pipe to the Joint Water Pollution Control Plant \( JWPCP \) The remaining materials that sank are then sent into our secondary tanks Third Step Secondary The secondary tanks have two sections , an anoxic zone and an aeration zone The anoxic zone favors organisms that break down nitrogen compounds , such as ammonia \( your pee \) , nitrate , and nitrite , and the aeration zone favors organisms that break down most organic materials \( your poop \) This is where the real work is done At the end of this process any leftover organic material is recycled back into the plant We call this activated return sludge The recycled material actually helps keep the population of organisms alive and well to continue the process The secondary effluent moves into the secondary settling tanks Fourth Step Final The settled secondary water moves into final processing This process usually involves chemical additives Mostly ammonia \( hey ! I thought we removed that in the secondary stage ! \) and chlorine The final step is to disinfect the water The final effluent is then dechlorinated after a set amount of chlorination contact time The final effluent can then either be sent out as reclaimed water , mostly for use in agriculture , golf courses , or planters seen near freeways The overall process takes anywhere from 14 20 hours to complete Possible Fifth Step Any solids that can not be broken down are sent down to JWPCP and are then digested in an anaerobic digester Any solids that are n t broken down by this process are usually pressed , to remove the water , and sold as biomass for agriculture Of course the process is much more involved than what I explained here but that s the basic overview of the system For more information visit the following pages URL 2 URL 4 URL 0

0 Actual IT Professional Pseudo Computer Scientist here to answer this wonderful question ! Here is the answer To keep me in the job Kidding I will explain it like you 're five and I will be using this image of a cake my wife made as a makeshift example URL 0 The most common problems that are resolved via rebooting are with what is known as External Fragmentation External fragmentation arises when free memory is separated into small blocks and is interspersed by allocated memory It is a weakness of certain storage allocation algorithms , when they fail to order memory used by programs efficiently The result is that , although free storage is available , it is effectively unusable because it is divided into pieces that are too small individually to satisfy the demands of the application The term external refers to the fact that the unusable storage is outside the allocated regions As an example let 's use cake to represent external fragmentation , FOR SCIENCE ! Again , using the picture above as a reference Consider a situation wherein a program allocates 3 continuous blocks of memory 0x0000 \( green cake \) , 0x1000 \( pink cake \) , and 0x2000 \( purple cake \) and then frees the middle block \( or let 's say you need to serve out just the middle pink layer while leaving the rest of the cake intact \) The memory allocator can use this free block of memory for future allocations , to serve to a girl that likes pink cake for example However , it can not use this block if the memory to be allocated is larger in size than this free block In other words , it ca n't cut out just the pink portion of the cake because the girl wants more pink cake than what is available within your cake There is also internal fragmentation which causes similar issues When a program is started , the free memory areas are long and contiguous Over time and with use , the long contiguous regions become fragmented into smaller and smaller contiguous areas Eventually , it may become impossible for the program to obtain large contiguous chunks of memory More specifically , due to the rules governing memory allocation , more computer memory is sometimes allocated than is needed For example , memory can only be provided to programs in chunks divisible by 4 , 8 or 16 , and as a result if a program requests perhaps 23 bytes , it will actually get a chunk of 24 out of 0x2000 \( or in our tasty example , the purple layer of cake \) When this happens , the excess memory \( the 1 byte left over of tasty , moist , delicious purple cake in the warm little center of the cake \) goes to waste Oh , that 's not so much , is it \? Well over time it adds up , and before you know it , you have only dished out 80 of your purple cake yet all of it is somehow gone ! Unlike other types of fragmentation , internal fragmentation is difficult to reclaim usually the best way to remove it is with a design change For example , in dynamic memory allocation , memory pools drastically cut internal fragmentation by spreading the space overhead over a larger number of objects , or in our terms , it serves just enough pink cake to those who want pink cake , so that everyone whom wanted pink cake can have pink cake , but only exactly the amount they need to have at any given moment When you reboot , RAM is cleared completely \( you start with a new cake \) and everything starts fresh , causing the seemingly quick way to resolve performance issues \( or have a brand new cake \) There are other things that can cause the need to reboot , such as programs causing memory leaks , too many programs and not enough memory , and things of that nature However , external and internal fragmentation will almost certainly always be the 1 culprit in the long run

0 The Dow Jones Industrial Average \( DJIA \) is a Price weighted index That means that the index is calculated by adding up the prices of the constituent stocks and dividing by a constant , the Dow divisor \( The value of the Dow divisor is adjusted from time to time to maintain continuity when there are splits or changes in the roster \) This has the curious effect of giving a member of the index influence proportional to its share price That is , if a stock costing 100 per share goes up by 1 , that will change the index by 10 times as much as if a stock costing 10 per share goes up by the same 1 Now look at the price of Google It 's currently trading at just a whisker under 700 per share Most of the other stocks in the index trade somewhere between 30 and 150 , so if Google were included in the index it would contribute between 5 and 20 times the weight of any other stock in the index That means that relatively small blips in Google 's price would completely dominate the index on any given day Until June of 2014 , Apple was in the same boat , with its stock trading at about 700 per share At that time , Apple split its stock 7 1 , and after that its stock price was a little under 100 per share So , post split Apple might be a candidate to be included in the Dow the next time they change up the components of the index Since the Dow is fixed at 30 stocks , and since they try to keep a balance between different sectors , this probably would n't happen until they drop another technology company from the lineup for some reason \( Correction Apple is in the DJIA and has been for a little over a year now Mea culpa \) The Dow 's price weighting is unusual as stock indices go Most indices are weighted by market capitalization That means the influence of a single company is proportional to its total value This causes large companies like Apple to have a lot of influence on those indices , but since market capitalization is n't as arbitrary as stock price , most people see that as ok Also , notice that I said company and not stock When a company has multiple classes of share \( as Google does \) , market cap weighted indices include all of the share classes , while the Dow has no provision for such situations , which is another , albeit less important , reason why Google is n't in the Dow \( Keep this in mind the next time someone offers you a bar bet on how many stocks are in the S P 500 The answer is \( currently \) 505 ! \) Finally , you might be wondering why the Dow uses such an odd weighting in its calculations The answer is that the Dow averages go back to 1896 , when Charles Dow used to calculate the averages by hand If your only tools are a pencil and paper , then a price weighted index with only 30 stocks in it is a lot easier to calculate than a market cap weighted index with hundreds of constituents About the Dow Jones Averages Dow constituents and prices Apple 's stock price chart The split in 2014 is marked \( Note that prices before the split are retroactively adjusted to show a continuous curve \)

0 I want to caveat that I am not an active investor in Australia , you most likely should seek out other investors in your market and ask them for advice mentorship , but since you came here I can give you some generalized advice When investing in real estate there are a two main rules of thumb to quickly determine if the property will be a good investment The 50 rule and the 2 \( or 1 \) rule The 50 rules says that in general 50 if the income from the property will go to expenses not including debt service If you are bringing in 1000 a month 500 of that will go to utilities , taxes , repair , capital expenditures , advertising , lawn care , etc That leave you with 500 to pay the mortgage and if anything is left that can be cash flow As this is your first property and it is in a relatively bad neighbourhood you might consider bumping that up to 60 just to make sure you have padding The 1 or 2 rules says that the monthly rent should be 1 \( or 2 \) percent of the purchase price in this case the home is bought at 150 , 000 If the rent is 1 , 500 a month it might be a good investment but if it rents for 3 , 000 a month it probably is a good investment There are other factors to consider if a home meets the 2 rule it might be in a rough neighborhood which increases turnover which in general is the biggest expense in an investment property If a property meets one or both of these rules you should take a closer look at it and with proper due diligence determine that it is a deal These rules are just hard and fast guidelines to property analysis , they may need to be adapted to you market For example these rules will not hold in most \( all \? \) big cities

According to Publication 551 Inherited Property The basis of property inherited from a decedent is generally one of the following The FMV of the property at the date of the individual 's death The FMV on the alternate valuation date if the personal representative for the estate chooses to use alternate valuation For information on the alternate valuation date , see the Instructions for Form 706 The value under the special use valuation method for real property used in farming or a closely held business if chosen for estate tax purposes This method is discussed later FMV is Fair Market Value which is the price that a willing buyer would pay for the property with reasonable knowledge of all the facts of the property The rest generally apply to farmland or other special purpose land where the amount of income it generates is not properly reflected in the market value One or more real estate professionals will run comps that show you recent sales in the same area for similar houses to get a rough estimate of fair market value Does it go off of the tax appraised value \? Tax assessment may or may not be accurate depending on tax laws \( e g limits to tax increases \) and consistency with the actual market Should you , prior to your death , get an independent appraiser to appraise the value of the property and include that assessment of the properties value with the will or something \? That should not be necessary another appraisal will likely be done as part of the estate process after death One reason you might do one is if you are distributing different assets to different heirs , and you want to make sure that the estate is divided equitably

0 When lifting things our body balances the competing issues of strength needed and energy expended When we are tired , we tend to adopt the strategy which uses the least energy , which is bending at the waist to pick up an object This uses the least energy because only the torso and the object are moved against gravity The drawback \( pardon the pun \) is that lifting this way uses the weak muscles in your lower back and when you are bend over there is a large torque about your lower spine Both of these can facts can lead to you injuring your lower back The safer way to lift is to keep the object close you your spine and lift up with your strong legs instead of rotating up The reason that people do n't always do this , is that it requires much more energy to lift this way , sometimes 3 or 4 times the amount of energy as you are not just lifting the object , but almost your entire body mass That is why , as you get tired , your technique gets sloppy , and you tend to bend rather than squat to lift and you end up injuring yourself
0 The light field is a vector function that describes the amount of light flowing in every direction through every point in space The space of all possible light rays is given by the five dimensional plenoptic function , and the magnitude of each ray is given by its radiance Michael Faraday was the first to propose that light should be interpreted as a field , much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working The phrase light field was coined by Andrey Gershun in a classic 1936 paper on the radiometric properties of light in three dimensional space Modern approaches to light field display explore co designs of optical elements and compressive computation to achieve higher resolutions , increased contrast , wider fields of view , and other benefits The term radiance field may also be used to refer to similar concepts The term is used in modern research such as neural radiance fields

0 Because we are social animals \( URL 0 \) Tens of thousands of years ago our ancestors found there was a distinct survival advantage in working together in familial groups As such , we gradually augmented our existing survival attributes with social behaviours that would cause us to stay together when under stress Facial expressions , grooming each others fur , crying , touching , vocalisations etc All of these things help communicate individual feelings and establish social structures When you are being hugged or touched , your brain is rewarding you for taking part in actions that will improve your overall survival chances by releasing Oxytocin to calm your nervous system Remember , you are a product of a very , VERY long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms , stretching back millions of years The actions that kept you alive were rewarded with pleasure hormones \( eating , drinking , bonding , fucking , hugging etc \) The actions that reduced your chances are either not rewarded at all , or marked by an unpleasant sensation we call pain This is why most people get lonely when away from other people You 're reducing your survival chances and so your body is trying to compel you to return to your kind And hugging feels so good because you 're being rewarded for bonding with said kind

0 Shorter wavelengths have more energy , therefore are more likely to meet the required every to fulfil a photoelectric interaction with an atom As a consequence they are less likely to travel further , therefore decreasing their density as distance increases For sound there is the added effect that lower wavelengths can bend around objects that are smaller than their wavelength The effect is that you can hear lower frequency sounds better , further away from the source This applies to light as well , but due to very small wavelength it 's unlikely that another object wo n't exceed said wavelength Good luck with your exams

0 To understand this , you have to understand what exactly a seizure is Not all seizures are the shaking uncontrollably and wetting yourself type \( grand mal \) that you see in movies and tv shows Seizures are characterized by aberrant , synchronous neuronal activity in the brain and the outward symptoms can range from a momentary loss of time all the way up to muscular convulsions The best analogy I can think of for an ELI5 level is that part of the brain gets stuck in a feedback loop that grows with each cycle in a chain reaction Sometimes these ' feedback loops ' have a trigger , such as flashing lights or certain musical tones , but many times there is no identifiable trigger We do know that seizures are more common in people who have a lower excitation threshold in their brain \( if you want to know more about excitation thresholds , feel free to message me but the concept is a bit too complex for ELI5 \) If a normal person looks at a flashing light they might end up with a headache , while someone with a seizure disorder may experience a seizure Again , the seizure may be something as subtle as the person staring off into space for a few moments and not realizing the lost time Basically the brain has to respond to stimuli , and sometimes due to brain chemistry the stimuli causes synchronized activity \( like constructive interference with waves \) that overwhelms the normal dampening mechanisms the brain has in place which results in seizure activity

0 In mathematics and physics , a vector space \( also called a linear space \) is a set whose elements , often called vectors , may be added together and multiplied \( scaled \) by numbers called scalars Scalars are often real numbers , but can be complex numbers or , more generally , elements of any field The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements , called vector axioms The terms real vector space and complex vector space are often used to specify the nature of the scalars real coordinate space or complex coordinate space Vector spaces generalize Euclidean vectors , which allow modeling of physical quantities , such as forces and velocity , that have not only a magnitude , but also a direction The concept of vector spaces is fundamental for linear algebra , together with the concept of matrix , which allows computing in vector spaces This provides a concise and synthetic way for manipulating and studying systems of linear equations Vector spaces are characterized by their dimension , which , roughly speaking , specifies the number of independent directions in the space This means that , for two vector spaces with the same dimension , the properties that depend only on the vector space structure are exactly the same \( technically the vector spaces are isomorphic \) A vector space is finite dimensional if its dimension is a natural number Otherwise , it is infinite dimensional , and its dimension is an infinite cardinal Finite dimensional vector spaces occur naturally in geometry and related areas Infinite dimensional vector spaces occur in many areas of mathematics For example , polynomial rings are countably infinite dimensional vector spaces , and many function spaces have the cardinality of the continuum as a dimension Many vector spaces that are considered in mathematics are also endowed with other structures This is the case of algebras , which include field extensions , polynomial rings , associative algebras and Lie algebras This is also the case of topological vector spaces , which include function spaces , inner product spaces , normed spaces , Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces

0 Someone also told me recently that it means the winters will get colder too How \? It 's complex \( as in very , very complex \) and depends on the location This is why climate change is possibly a more apt term than global warming Warming on the surface is not uniform across the planet or across seasons Proportionally , water vapor in the atmosphere contributes naturally much more to the total greenhouse effect \( explained by Cross Keynesian \) than does carbon dioxide \( produced by burning fossil fuels \) There are massive amounts of water in the air and it circulates relatively fast and in complex patterns Adding to the complexity is the fact that water vapor is a greenhouse gas , but cloud cover can also have the opposite effect by reflecting sun 's radiation back to space instead of allowing it to the surface Overall warming makes the oceans warmer and makes for more evaporation of water into the air , which makes for both more water vapor and more clouds One of the big debates about climate change has been whether this feedback mechanism on adding carbon dioxide counteracts the greenhouse effect of the carbon dioxide , or actually makes it worse At least some of the early predictions of a very strong positive feedback on warming have not turned out to be accurate , otherwise we 'd be basically fried already

0 Music is based on ratios The perceived pitch of a note is based on its \( principal \) frequency Our perception of the distance between two notes is determined not by the difference of their frequencies , but by the ratio of their frequencies Suppose that you pluck a string and measure its movement You will see see a vibration corresponding to a wave the length of the string The frequency of this vibration is called the fundamental frequency of the pitch you hear But you will also see vibrations corresponding to the string vibrating in halves , and in thirds , and so on These vibrations will produce sounds with frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency These sounds are called overtones , or collectively the overtone series of the fundamental They are generally quieter than the fundamental Any vibrating object will produce overtones Your ear and brain will interpret the combined sound of these frequencies as a single sound , rather than flooding your auditory awareness with the whole range of them separately The pitch you perceive will be the loudest frequency \( almost always the fundamental \) , and the relative prevalence of the different overtones \( determined by the physical properties of the vibrating object \) make the difference between , say , a trumpet and a clarinet playing the same pitch If a sound does not seem to have a definite pitch , then the vibrating object producing it is probably vibrating in a more chaotic manner due to its physical properties Most drums are like this they produce a whole mess of frequencies , and they are said to be unpitched Timpani \( kettledrums \) , however , are designed to emphasize a certain frequency , and although they have a fuzzy drumlike sound , a single fundamental and series of overtones predominates , resulting in a definite pitch Bells are another interesting example When you hear a bell , it often sounds like more than one definite pitch is being produced by the bell This is because the bell vibrates in a manner that produces more than one fundamental and series of overtones Your brain combines each overtone series into some fundamental , but it ca n't combine every overtone you hear into a single fundamental , so you hear more than one pitch There are some weird applications of this In Ravel 's famous Bolero , he uses flutes and piccolo to simulate the sound of a bell by having them play different pitches to manually supply the correct fundamentals and overtones Anyway , all of this concerns how a single pitch is produced When we make music , we generally use more than one pitch But with an infinite number of possible frequencies , how did we decide to use a certain set of pitches \? The answer is that some sets of pitches are more harmonious than others What does it mean for a set of pitches to be harmonious \? Well , simply put , it means that their overtone series line up nicely Suppose that you have a pitch of frequency N This pitch consists of a fundamental at N and overtones at 2N , 3N , etc Then suppose that you introduce a second pitch at 2N This pitch will have overtones at 4N , 6N , etc The overtones overlap completely ! This ratio , 2 1 , is the simplest in music , and we call it the octave Notes separated by an octave are so similar sounding to us that we say that they are in the same pitch class For example , if you start at middle C on a piano \( also called C4 \) and go an octave up , you will reach another note called C \( C5 \) , and an octave below middle C is called C3 Much of music theory is really concerned with pitch classes like C rather than pitches like C4 Given some starting pitch , we have all sorts of octaves of that pitch , but they sound so similar than we ca n't really make much music out of them alone So we move on to the next simplest ratio , 3 1 Now , first , observe that a ratio of 3 1 is the same as a ratio of 3 2 multiplied by 2 1 \( the octave \) Because we consider pitches separated by an octave to be in the same class , we treat the ratios of 3 1 and 3 2 as describing the same sort of interval For convenience , we usually talk about the interval in it 's 3 2 form We call this interval the fifth , or the perfect fifth in some contexts If you have a starting pitch with fundamental frequency N and a second pitch a fifth above it at 1 5N , then the second pitches overtone series will be 3N , 4 5N , etc Obviously , there is some overlap between this pitch 's overtones and pitch N 's overtones \( 2N , 3N hellip \) Observe that all of these frequencies are overtones of the pitch 5N , which is one octave below N The combination of these two pitches \( N and 1 5N \) is perceived to be harmonious because their common root ndash the highest pitch that would contain both their overtone series ndash is so close to the notes Once you have the octave and the fifth , you can reach all manner of pitches by stacking intervals For instance , two fifths will give you a ratio of 9 4 , which you can scale up or down with octaves into 9 2 , 9 8 , or \( if you really want \) 9 1024 In fact , just having these two intervals to work with lets us get arbitrarily close to any frequency we want , which puts us right back where we started as far as deciding which pitches we 're going to use The way out of this , for Western music , is to observe that twelve fifths gives us the ratio 531441 4096 \( about 129 7 1 \) , which is really close to seven octaves \( 128 1 \) If we take that 1 5 1 ratio that makes a fifth and shrink it juuust a little bit to 1 498 1 , then twelve fifths makes exactly seven octaves The infinite line of pitch classes off to either side of your starting note becomes a circle \( the circle of fifths \) , where you hit eleven more pitch classes before returning where you started These are the twelve pitch classes of Western music , called the chromatic collection All you need to fully define a chromatic collection is to pick a starting frequency and go in fifths from there Nowadays , we usually say that 440 Hz is a pitch called A4 \( Note that the actual historical process of transitioning from the pure 3 2 ratio to this easier to manage system was a lot messier than described here They tried to solve the problem by saying that most fifths are perfectly 3 2 , but others are not quite All sorts of interesting compromise approaches were proposed before the modern standard of equal temperament won out \) In the chromatic collection , just as there are twelve pitch classes , there are twelve possible intervals between pitch classes \( up to an octave \) By restricting the set of pitches , you also restrict the set of intervals The smallest interval is called the semitone or minor second Its ratio is 1 059 1 , and all other intervals ' ratios are multiple of this ratio The interval of two semitones \( 1 122 1 \) is called a whole tone or major second When you take some collection of pitch classes \( such as the chromatic collection \) and squeeze it into the space of one octave , you call the resultant sequence of notes a scale A scale is defined by the pitches in it and by the starting note , or root As you may know , a traditional Western musical scale has seven pitch classes in it , not twelve A set of seven notes as used in a major scale or natural minor scale is called a diatonic collection \( A major scale can be turned intoa natural minor scale , or vice versa , by picking a different pitch from the collection to be root \) You get a diatonic collection by picking a starting pitch class and repeatedly taking fifths , but whereas in the chromatic collection you keep going until you reach your starting point again , in the diatonic collection you stop when you have seven notes Why seven \? The resultant scale will have a property called maximal evenness for any number of steps between notes on the scale , there are at most two different intervals that you could form by taking that number of steps For instance , the interval between two notes one step apart could only be a semitone or whole tone \( a minor second or major second \) , and the interval between two notes four steps apart could only be a perfect fifth \( seven semitones \) or a diminished fifth \( six semitones \) \( The apparent off by one error between the number of steps and the name of the interval is historical if you go up four steps , then you have looked at five notes counting your starting point \) There is exactly one other sort of scale made of fifths with the maximal evenness property If you take five notes instead of seven , then you end up with the pentatonic collection You can not form intervals of a semitone or a tritone \( seven semitones , also called an augmented fourth or diminished fifth \) with the notes in this collection , so it is , in a sense , incomplete The interval between adjacent notes in a pentatonic scale is either a whole tone or a minor third \( three semitones \) The essential quality of this scale is that the intervals excluded \( the semitone and tritone \) are the most dissonant intervals For this reason , it is easy to write music using a pentatonic collection that is pleasant , and difficult to write music that is discordant Of course , when you 're actually writing music , you can use extra pitch classes if you like a scale is not a straightjacket You can look at a pentatonic scale as a diatonic scale with two pitch classes missing You can also look at it the other way Adding different notes to a pentatonic scale may give you interesting effects For instance , if you add a certain note to a pentatonic scale , you get a blues scale \( Continued \)

0 As cryptocurrencies are rather new compared to most assets , there has n't been a lot of specific guidance for a lot of situation , but in 2014 the IRS announced that it published guidance in Notice 2014 21 I'm not aware of further guidance that has been published beyond that , though it would n't surprise me if treatments changed over time In that notice , the answer to the first question describes the general treatment For federal tax purposes , virtual currency is treated as property General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency Your specific questions \( about what constitutes a business , and when you 're considered to be selling the cryptoproperty \) are likely to be considered on a case by case basis by the IRS As the amounts involved here are so small \( relatively speaking \) , my recommendation would be to read through what the IRS has published carefully , make reasonable assumptions about what scenarios that are described are closest to what you 're doing , and document doing so clearly as part of your tax preparations And when in doubt , erring on the side of whichever option incurs more tax is unlikely to be objected to by them Of course , I'm not a lawyer or tax advisor , I'm a stranger on the Internet , so for real advice you should contact somebody qualified I doubt you 'd be faulted too much for not doing so given the amounts involved You could also attempt contacting a local IRS office or calling them with your specific questions , and they may be able to provide more specific guidance tailored to you , though doing so may not save you from an auditor deciding something differently if they were to examine your return later There are also phone numbers to contact specific people listed at the end of Notice 2014 21 you could try calling them as well

0 They actually do n't I attended a lock picking workshop about a year ago , and the guy who was running it was a professional locksmith He told us that there 's literally thousands of key lock combinations on different doors throughout our city that can work with each other interchangeably This does n't even apply to keys that are identical copies , either Let 's say you have two sets of keys and locks that are identical except for one pin we 'll call them lock 1 , key 1 , etc Lock 2 is designed so that one pin is shorter than the pin in lock 1 By putting in key 1 into lock 2 , it 's likely that the key , sliding into the lock , will bump that pin up just enough so that it allows the lock to rotate so tl dr I mean you obviously ca nt open someone elses door with your keys , even if key and lock are from the same company You actually might be able to , although it 's unlikely that they gave you guys the same keys and locks \( or ones similar enough to work interchangeably \)
0 Much of it came about due to sex being a sin in the middle ages Many forms of pleasure where seen as sins because the various churches thought to be morally upright , you had to live a very stark lifestyle Gradually people became more and more aware of sex as something to be done for reproduction and pleasure Just about a century ago , oral and anal sex were absolutely unheard of and seen as vulgar , though now they are seen as perfectly acceptable As human nature evolves their sexual acceptance of different things will as well
0 First of all , I'm happy that the medical treatments were successful I ca n't even imagine what you were going through However , you are now faced with a not so uncommon reality that many households face Here 's some other options you might not have thought of I would avoid adding more debt if at all possible I would first focus on the the cost side With a good income you can also squeeze every last dollar out of your budget to send them to school I agree with your dislike of parent loans for the same reasons , plus they do n't encourage cost savings and there 's no asset to give back if school does n't work out \( roughly half of all students that start college do n't graduate \) I would also avoid borrowing more than 80 of your home 's value to avoid PMI or higher loan rates You also say that you can pay off the HELOC in 5 years why can you do that but not cash flow the college \? Also note that a second mortgage may be worse that a HELOC the fees will be higher , and you still wo n't be able to borrow more that what the house is worth
0 Cheap oil is a good thing for the consumer , and it is a great thing for the shipping industry It is a bad thing for the oil industry Countries that are highly dependent on the oil industry like the OPEC nation , Canada , and Russia are having issues due to prices The US which has a much smaller percentage of its GDP dependent on oil is doing very well as a whole even though the oil industry is suffering here
